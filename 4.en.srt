00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,960
Who is it?

4
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,510
How did you get here?

5
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,040
I followed you.

6
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,790
Do you think
the silver coins we gave you

7
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,870
are not enough to show our sincerity?

8
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,710
Your Royal Highness, you misunderstood.

9
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,520
I came

10
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,520
to thank you specially

11
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
and also to bid farewell.

12
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,800
If I don't come,

13
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,960
I will die with everlasting regret.

14
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,150
It was my son's mischief

15
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,560
that made you and your daughter suffer.

16
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,430
You should leave quickly.

17
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,840
What do you want?

18
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,420
(Yang Tiexin)

19
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,910
Please do not touch it.

20
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,630
This is my most precious possession.

21
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,080
You should leave now.

22
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,310
There was a pair

23
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,080
of these iron spears.

24
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,560
Now

25
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,590
there is only one left.

26
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,840
The plow head is broken.

27
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,360
Tomorrow,

28
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,310
tell Zhang Mu from the East Village

29
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,520
to fix it

30
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,960
with a half catty of iron.

31
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,550
Xiruo,

32
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,750
the plow head is broken

33
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,150
Tomorrow, tell Zhang Mu
from the East Village

34
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,200
to fix it with a half catty of iron.

35
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,030
Who exactly are you?

36
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,680
How do you know what my husband said

37
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,310
the night he died?

38
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,510
Tiexin?

39
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,070
Xiruo.

40
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,070
You are Tiexin?

41
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,270
Xiruo.

42
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,240
Tiexin!

43
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,200
Xiruo.

44
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,240
Take me away.

45
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,390
Take me to the underworld.

46
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,600
I want to be a ghost with you.

47
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,680
If it weren't for the child,

48
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,390
I would have come to find you long ago.

49
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,000
Do I look like

50
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,800
a ghost to you?

51
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,720
How did you survive?

52
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,150
Mom.

53
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,630
It's going to snow.

54
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,270
Is it cold in the room?

55
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,630
Let me help you make a fire.

56
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,640
It's not cold.

57
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,270
It's very warm

58
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,760
inside the house.

59
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,270
Is it warm enough?

60
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,510
It's been frosty and rainy.

61
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,510
You must feel cold.

62
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,440
Mom.

63
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,920
Who are you talking to?

64
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,120
I'm already in the bed.

65
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,630
Aren't you in the bed?

66
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,100
Why are you staring at
the cabinet in a daze?

67
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,390
I'm going to bed now.

68
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,230
Kang.

69
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,270
You should rest early too.

70
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,440
Mom.

71
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,050
Are you keeping something from me?

72
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,960
No, not at all.

73
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,560
Am I your real son?

74
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,270
Of course you are.

75
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,000
Then why are you always...

76
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,950
Why do you

77
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,480
always hide things from me?

78
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,870
Just like...

79
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,190
Kang, stop it!

80
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,870
He is your

81
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,720
biological father.

82
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,640
How is that possible?

83
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,030
Mom.

84
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,320
You must be crazy.

85
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,560
My father is Prince Zhao
of the Jin Empire.

86
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,560
How could he be my dad?

87
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,720
What are you talking about?

88
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,240
I'm telling the truth.

89
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,430
You're not from the Jin Empire.

90
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,630
You're one of the Hans.

91
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,560
Your name is not Wanyan Kang.

92
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,240
Your real surname is Yang.

93
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,630
Your name

94
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,070
should be Yang Kang.

95
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,310
What are you talking about?

96
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,360
It's absolutely true.

97
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,430
I'm telling you now

98
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,480
word by word.

99
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,070
Your biological father is him.

100
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,920
His name is Yang Tiexin.

101
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,320
I want to find my father.

102
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,820
I want my father to talk to you.

103
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,320
Kang.

104
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,550
Your father is here.

105
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,280
Son.

106
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,960
Take a look.

107
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,200
What words are carved on this spear?

108
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,710
Yang

109
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,270
Tiexin.

110
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,270
(Yang Tiexin)
Your biological father

111
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,790
used to use this iron spear a lot.

112
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,630
His name is carved on it.

113
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,750
Tiexin.

114
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,590
No.

115
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,550
This guy's surname is Mu.

116
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,720
His daughter is Mu Nianci.

117
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,990
Mom.

118
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
You must have been deceived.

119
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,440
You must have been deceived.

120
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,910
How could he deceive me?

121
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,240
Come and see for yourself.

122
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,550
Don't you always ask me

123
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,240
where did this iron plow come from?

124
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,720
And these tables and stools.

125
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,440
All the furnishings inside this room

126
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,030
were transported

127
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,840
all the way from Niujia Village

128
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,600
to here.

129
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,080
Every piece of furnishings

130
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,790
in this room

131
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,440
is something that your biological father

132
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,870
and I used to use.

133
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,750
What's so good about all this crap?

134
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,790
Everything in the palace

135
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,960
is better than them.

136
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,720
But in my eyes,

137
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,480
these old things

138
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,600
are much better

139
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,960
than the fine furniture in the palace,

140
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,480
my child.

141
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,440
You really have no luck.

142
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,600
You didn't grow up

143
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,550
with your biological father

144
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,840
in a shabby place surrounded
by these things.

145
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,360
Isn't that my blessing?

146
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,230
Mom.

147
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,120
You're being unreasonable.

148
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,910
He can't be my father.

149
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,720
He's a spy who broke into the palace.

150
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,600
I have to kill him.

151
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,080
Mom.

152
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,870
I'll kill him for you now.

153
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,840
Kang!

154
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,000
If you act recklessly like this,

155
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,840
I will have to

156
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,000
die in front of you.

157
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,840
- Mother!
- Xiruo!

158
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,150
Xiruo!

159
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,800
Xiruo.

160
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,040
Xiruo.

161
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,630
Why did you do this to yourself?

162
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,960
Xiruo.

163
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,200
Xiruo.

164
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,750
Let go of my mother!

165
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,120
Let my mother go!

166
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,720
Only sons in the Yang family

167
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,240
can learn this move.

168
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,240
I believe your master
did not teach you this.

169
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,280
Dad.

170
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,350
Daughter.

171
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,710
Nianci.

172
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,080
This is my wife

173
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,920
that I told you about

174
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,480
countless times.

175
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,320
Xiruo.

176
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,000
This is my adopted daughter,

177
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,440
Mu Nianci.

178
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,560
Mom?

179
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,280
My child.

180
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,320
Let's go.

181
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,080
Rong.

182
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,960
I finally found you!

183
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,230
Jing.

184
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,440
Follow me.

185
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,480
They are over here.

186
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,960
Quick.

187
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,320
Go get them.

188
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,230
Go.

189
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,200
Don't let them escape.

190
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,110
What should we do?

191
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,040
Jing.

192
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,110
It's a dry well.

193
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,960
Quick.

194
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,160
Go take a look over there.

195
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,270
- Let's hide in here.
- Okay.

196
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,040
Jing.

197
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,960
Rong.

198
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,630
Who is there?

199
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,270
Rong, run!

200
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,390
I remember your voice.

201
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,190
You are the apprentice
of the Seven Freaks of Jiangnan.

202
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,870
It's a pity that I didn't

203
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,720
get rid of you last time.

204
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,790
Since you came to meet your doom,

205
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,360
I will grant your wish.

206
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,960
Mei Ruohua.

207
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,240
How do you know my real name?

208
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,560
Who are you?

209
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,510
Swing the sword admist peach blossoms,

210
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,750
playing the song on a jade flute.

211
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,350
My last name is Huang.

212
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,040
You are...

213
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,630
The Tanzhi Peak, Qingyin Cave,

214
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,590
Green Bamboo Grove,

215
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,350
and Sword Trial Pavilion
on the Peach Blossom Island.

216
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,320
Do you still remember them?

217
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,160
Master?

218
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,870
Good.

219
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,440
You haven't forgot my father.

220
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,670
The old man

221
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,730
still hasn't forgotten about you.

222
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,350
He

223
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,840
came to see you in person.

224
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,360
Master is here?

225
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,390
Don't try to fool me.

226
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,320
So you've gone too far in your practice

227
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,280
and can't walk.

228
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,590
Jing.

229
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,720
Fallen Petals Sword Palm.

230
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,150
Not bad.

231
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,790
This move is called
Flying Flowers in Jiangcheng.

232
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,670
My father taught you that.

233
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,350
You didn't forget, did you?

234
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,680
Huang,

235
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:05,680
where is my master?

236
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,520
Senior Mei,

237
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,160
now you have a chance
to make amends for your mistakes.

238
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,590
What chance?

239
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,920
Some people are bullying me.

240
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,310
You drive them away.

241
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
My father always listens to me.

242
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,550
When my father arrives,

243
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,310
I will plead for you.

244
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,550
I will be at your service.

245
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,720
You thief!

246
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,720
Nine Yin Skeleton Claw?

247
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,160
And you say you have no relationship

248
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,390
with the Twin Killers in the Dark Wind.

249
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,310
Your master is clearly Mei Chaofeng.

250
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,480
My master?

251
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,930
Let her practice
for another hundred years

252
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,150
and see if she'll be qualified.

253
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,070
Do you think I am qualified?

254
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,240
Senior Mei.

255
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,550
It was this villain

256
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,760
who tried to bully me.

257
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,800
Huang.

258
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,920
You were just trying to trick me, right?

259
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,920
If Master is really nearby,

260
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,790
these people wouldn't dare
to be so arrogant.

261
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,390
Senior Mei.

262
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,510
What do you mean by this?

263
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,700
Tell me the mental cultivation methods
of Peach Blossom Island,

264
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,550
and I will naturally
help you vent your anger.

265
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,720
Okay.

266
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,440
Sit cross-legged,

267
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,790
point five centers to the sky.

268
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,750
Five centers?

269
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,720
The center of your palms,

270
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,680
your feet,

271
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,800
and your head.

272
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:34,760
Those are the five centers.

273
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,950
Rong.

274
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,310
The martial arts
of Peach Blossom Island

275
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,240
aren't fun.

276
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,830
You should ask me to be your master

277
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,150
and come to the Mount White Camel with me.

278
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,990
How dare you insult
the Peach Blossom Island.

279
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,440
- I should kill you.
- How bold!

280
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,440
This woman is very powerful.

281
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,640
Be careful, everyone.

282
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,670
However powerful she is,

283
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,510
she's blind.

284
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,920
I don't know
if the Copper Corpse is here.

285
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,430
Let's not worry about it for now.

286
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,030
Find a way to kill her first.

287
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Let's do it together.

288
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,000
This way!

289
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,590
I'm already lucky enough

290
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,200
to have reunited with my wife today.

291
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,510
Even if I have to die now,

292
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,350
I am satisfied.

293
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,590
Don't talk nonsense, Tiexin.

294
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,400
I'll stay with you even if I die.

295
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,080
Child,

296
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,200
run for your life.

297
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,680
No, I want to be with you.

298
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,040
Fine.

299
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,720
Having a wife

300
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,000
and a daughter like this,

301
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,960
what more could I ask for?

302
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,790
Guard the city gate

303
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,310
and bring back the Princess.

304
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,670
Kang!

305
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,550
Are you really going to

306
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,790
make your own biological father die?

307
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,750
That thief has bewitched the Princess.

308
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,320
The reward for killing him

309
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,880
is one hundred taels.

310
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,800
Take care of your mother.

311
00:20:59,070 --> 00:20:59,910
This way!

312
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,520
Kang.

313
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,720
I'm Yang Tiexin.

314
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,160
May I have your name?

315
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,590
Thank God!

316
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,790
You're still alive.

317
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,200
I am Ma Yu from the Quanzhen School.

318
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,160
Master Qiu Chuji and I

319
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,070
are close friends.

320
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,920
Please help me get away.

321
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,840
Yang.

322
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,480
I will take you out of the city now.

323
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,190
Kang.

324
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,000
This person is the head
of the Quanzhen School.

325
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,830
Usual soldiers can't deal with him.

326
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,830
Go to the palace

327
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,510
to invite some masters to help.

328
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,960
Yes, Father.

329
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,760
- Dad.
- Daughter.

330
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,840
- Let's go.
- This way.

331
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,070
Make sure to get

332
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,070
the Princess back.

333
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,040
Yes.

334
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,510
This woman's legs are paralyzed.

335
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,200
She's depending on the kid in the back.

336
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,720
That's her weakness.

337
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,310
Kill him first.

338
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,400
- Rong.
- Everyone, please stop.

339
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,920
We're all on the same side.

340
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,350
What do you mean?

341
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,270
We are all martial arts practitioners.

342
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,990
We should settle scores
according to the rules of the martial world.

343
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,000
Please stay out of this, Your Highness.

344
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,640
My mother has been kidnapped by a villain.

345
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,720
The situation is urgent
on my father's side.

346
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,750
Are you all going to stand by
and do nothing?

347
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,000
Prince Zhao made a generous offer
to invite me to come.

348
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,440
Now there is trouble in the palace,

349
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,200
how can we just sit back?

350
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,790
The Princess has been kidnapped.

351
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,350
If we don't go to help,

352
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,310
it will be difficult to establish
a foothold in the palace in the future.

353
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,520
Witch.

354
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,590
I'll make a note of this.

355
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:05,880
Lead the way, Your Highness.

356
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,840
Let's save the Princess first.

357
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,760
Go.

358
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,910
Senior Mei.

359
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,630
Second master.

360
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,350
Masters.

361
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,870
Masters, don't chase after them.

362
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,040
Jing.

363
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,950
What are you doing?

364
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,790
Why are you together with that witch?

365
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,960
She just saved me.

366
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,590
Master Wang Chuyi

367
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,830
was poisoned.

368
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,480
I came here to find the antidote.

369
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,200
But there were some villains

370
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,040
trying to kill me.

371
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,680
Then I encountered Mei Chaofeng.

372
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,680
She drove away those villains

373
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,670
and saved me.

374
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

375
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,750
We searched everywhere for her
but couldn't find her.

376
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,070
Today we finally met her.

377
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,150
Can't let her escape.

378
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,080
Forget it.

379
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,310
Jing won't lie.

380
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,000
Since she saved Jing once,

381
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,750
we should be grateful

382
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,270
and let her off this time.

383
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,680
Consider it as repaying her favor.

384
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,840
This makes sense.

385
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,590
Moreover, when we fought with her,

386
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,920
she was already seriously injured,

387
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,430
If we kill her now,

388
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,680
people will say

389
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,990
we took advantage of her vulnerability.

390
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,840
That's right.

391
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,800
So be it.

392
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,830
Next time I see her,

393
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,110
I will definitely kill her.

394
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,870
You're awake.

395
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,000
Thanks a lot to your help.

396
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,110
Don't thank me.

397
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
You helped me once.

398
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,080
And I helped you.

399
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,840
Let's call it even.

400
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,400
I'm also afraid that my father will know

401
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,830
I let someone from
the Peach Blossom Island

402
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,750
die at the hands of others.

403
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,000
He'll blame me in the future.

404
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,510
So my master

405
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,430
didn't come.

406
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:17,910
That's right.

407
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,400
How could he deliberately

408
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,920
come to see me, a traitor?

409
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,750
Do you really want to see him?

410
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,440
Aren't you afraid he will kill you?

411
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,000
I am afraid.

412
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,160
But I still want to see him.

413
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,000
No matter how he punishes me,

414
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,160
I am willing to accept it.

415
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,270
I used to

416
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,440
hear my father mention

417
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,310
you ungrateful disciples.

418
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,040
So

419
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,840
this time I passed on
the mental cultivation methods

420
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,350
because I pitied you for him.

421
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,490
Otherwise, if you continue
to cultivate like this,

422
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,480
the paralysis of both legs
is just the beginning.

423
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,830
You will definitely die in the future.

424
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,030
Thank you then.

425
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,200
By the way, why did you come to the palace?

426
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,160
Tell me about it.

427
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,190
That day,

428
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,880
after the battle
with the Seven Freaks of Jiangnan,

429
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,680
I was shot blind by Ke Zhen'e.

430
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,000
Xuanfeng was killed by the Seven Freaks.

431
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,310
To avoid the Seven Freaks,

432
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,310
I hid in the Sixth Prince's palace.

433
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,680
They thought I was only

434
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,110
a pitiful blind woman,

435
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,640
so they arrange for me to work in a

436
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,160
deserted backyard.

437
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,200
I secretly practiced martial arts at night.

438
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,070
No one noticed it

439
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,830
in the first couple of months.

440
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,880
Until one day,

441
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,350
he caught me practicing.

442
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,910
Who is there?

443
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,270
I never expected

444
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,400
that in the palace,

445
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,000
(Young Wanyan Kang)
there's a remarkable expert

446
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,350
hidden in here.

447
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,880
Your Highness.

448
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,270
Rest assured.

449
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,790
I know you don't want

450
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,400
others to know
about your martial arts skills.

451
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,160
I will never tell anyone.

452
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,960
I have thought of

453
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,590
a more discreet location.

454
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,790
No one

455
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,160
will disturb your practice here.

456
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,870
Your Highness.

457
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,440
Why are you helping me like this?

458
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,200
I want to be your disciple

459
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,310
to learn martial arts.

460
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,750
I should have killed him,

461
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,640
but he has a noble identity.

462
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,270
Harming him will bring big trouble.

463
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,320
Furthermore,

464
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,790
I am grateful that his father saved me.

465
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,830
So I agreed to teach him.

466
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,950
So

467
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,110
I stayed in the palace.

468
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,590
Quick.

469
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,390
This way!

470
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,040
Quick.

471
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,190
- Xiruo.
- Mother!

472
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,200
- How is it?
- How are you?

473
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,590
It's hard to get away

474
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,160
taking all of us.

475
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,520
I feel

476
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,200
really bad about it.

477
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,750
Don't say that, Yang.

478
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,110
Let's first find our way

479
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,040
down the mountain.

480
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,430
Mr. Ma.

481
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,790
If we go down the mountain like this,

482
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,490
we'll inevitably encounter pursuers.

483
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,760
Don't worry.

484
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,200
I have already left marks

485
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,070
of our Quanzhen School along the way.

486
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,830
My two junior martial brothers,

487
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,270
Qiu Chuji and Wang Chuyi,

488
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,430
are both nearby.

489
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,160
Once they see them,

490
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,240
they will come to help us.

491
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,240
Master Qiu will come?

492
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,510
With the support of the two of them,

493
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,870
those Jin soldiers

494
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:05,870
can't stop us.

495
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,110
- Good.
- Let's go.

496
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:08,950
Over there.

497
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,240
- Don't let him run away.
- This way.

498
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,800
Quick.

499
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,550
- This way.
- Oh no.

500
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,240
I'll fight them!

501
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,240
Yang.

502
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,240
I'll stop them.

503
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,240
You guys go quickly.

504
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,270
Dad, protect Mom.

505
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,040
Come back.

506
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:27,910
Quick.

507
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,350
Quick.

508
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,440
Not one can get away.

509
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,590
I'm going to kill that villain.

510
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,150
Dad.

511
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,720
Kang, stop it!

512
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,950
Yang.

513
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,550
I finally found you!

514
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,670
Master Qiu.

515
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,090
It's been eighteen years since
we parted ways in Niujia Village.

516
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,880
It feels like a lifetime ago.

517
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,030
Master, it's me.

518
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,090
I never had a disciple like you

519
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,400
who took a villain as a father.

520
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,030
Are you going to kill me?

521
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,630
Master, be careful.

522
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,720
Stop it!

523
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,680
Sure enough, you are the young prince.

524
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,520
Qiu Chuji.

525
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,070
You were hit by the bone-piercing nail.

526
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,960
You don't have much time left.

527
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,350
Master, I didn't mean it.

528
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,310
Good disciple.

529
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,240
Good disciple.

530
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,480
Junior.

531
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,690
Use your internal energy to detoxify.

532
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,160
- I will protect you.
- Okay.

533
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,750
Master, I'm here to help you.

534
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:02,870
Tiexin!

535
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,190
Tiexin!

536
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,040
If you want to kill him,

537
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,030
you have to kill me first.

538
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,040
Stop.

539
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,590
Do not hurt the Princess.

540
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,240
Xiruo.

541
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,560
Come back with me.

542
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,310
I will not go back with you.

543
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,040
Mom.

544
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,000
Why are you still protecting that villain?

545
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,480
Come back quickly.

546
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,880
Father will forgive you.

547
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,200
I'm not going back.

548
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,440
My husband is still alive.

549
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,240
I will stay with him forever.

550
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,680
If he goes to the ends of the earth,

551
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,240
I'll follow him.

552
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,110
Mom.

553
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,390
If you go with him,

554
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,800
what should I do?

555
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,640
Don't you want me anymore?

556
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,840
Don't you want our family anymore?

557
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,030
You traitor.

558
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,190
You've taken the enemy as your father

559
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,320
for eighteen years.

560
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,590
Now your biological father is here,

561
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,280
don't you want to recognize him?

562
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,320
Master.

563
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,920
My father is Wanyan Honglie,

564
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,840
my name is Wanyan Kang.

565
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,000
He raised me.

566
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,710
These eighteen years of affection

567
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,510
cannot be replaced by anyone.

568
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,350
I have only

569
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,590
met this person twice.

570
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,150
Why should I acknowledge him?

571
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,680
Child,

572
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,510
it's not your fault.

573
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,150
After all, you were born

574
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,590
in this palace.

575
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,400
But back then,

576
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,110
I entered the palace

577
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,360
for you.

578
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,320
Xiruo.

579
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,400
Are you telling the truth?

580
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,800
All these years,

581
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,760
you've never treated me as your husband,

582
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,800
or this place

583
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,920
as your own home?

584
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,960
In the past eighteen years,

585
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,380
although everyone calls me princess

586
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,440
in the palace,

587
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,480
in my heart, I know

588
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,880
I have long been
married to the Yang family.

589
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,710
I live and die with him.

590
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,190
I am not worthy of you,
Your Royal Highness.

591
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,200
I don't care.

592
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,000
I only care about you.

593
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,710
All these years,

594
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,550
you have always been

595
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,790
thinking about the past,

596
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,980
and I have been trying

597
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,960
to find ways

598
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,320
to help you forget the past.

599
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,120
For you,

600
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,510
I am willing to give up everything,

601
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,320
even if I have to

602
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,190
abandon the throne.

603
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,630
Look at the court officials,

604
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,070
everyone has wives and concubines.

605
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,150
But you alone

606
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,800
are enough for me.

607
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,200
Your Royal Highness,

608
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,280
I'm sorry.

609
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,670
I don't want you to say sorry!

610
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,480
I want you to tell me,

611
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
have you not had

612
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,760
any feelings for me

613
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,400
over these years?

614
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,360
I used to think

615
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,840
my husband had passed away,

616
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,450
so I intended
to spend the rest of my life

617
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,590
serving you

618
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,320
and repaying your kindness.

619
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,680
But now

620
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,400
my husband is still alive.

621
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,070
I can no longer accept

622
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,800
your affection anymore.

623
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,600
Xiruo.

624
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,440
I've loved you dearly

625
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,070
for eighteen years.

626
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,190
Unexpectedly,

627
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,400
those years were wasted after all.

628
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,470
Your Royal Highness,

629
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,630
I have never asked anything of you.

630
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,880
But today I want to beg you

631
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,190
to let me and Tiexin go.

632
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,160
Don't beg him!

633
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,350
Impossible.

634
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,030
Even if I can't

635
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,670
get your love in my life,

636
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,070
I won't let him get what he wants.

637
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,550
Whoever dares to stop me

638
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,510
from welcoming back the Princess

639
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,960
will be killed!

640
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,160
Father.

641
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,070
Junior.

642
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:49,990
Junior.

643
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,480
Things have come to this.

644
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,840
I'm afraid there is no escape.

645
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:54,950
So what?

646
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,760
The followers of Quanzhen School

647
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,510
aren't afraid of death.

648
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,600
Wait a moment.

649
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,960
Everything today started

650
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,000
because of me.

651
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,480
I don't want to bring trouble to anyone.

652
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,280
Wanyan Honglie.

653
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,360
If you were a man,

654
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,590
don't involve the innocent people.

655
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,320
Today,

656
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,030
I will

657
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,190
give you an explanation.

658
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:26,870
- Yang!
- Don't!

659
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,070
- Yang!
- Dad!

660
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,550
- Tiexin!
- Dad!

661
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,800
Tiexin!

662
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,070
Dad!

663
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,240
Xiruo.

664
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,950
- Come back with me.
- Don't come over.

665
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,030
Dad.

666
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,120
Your Royal Highness,

667
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,510
you saved my life.

668
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,600
Today,

669
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,070
I'm returning it to you.

670
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,320
We are even in this lifetime.

671
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,030
Don't!

672
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,230
- Mother!
- Xiruo!

673
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,070
Mother!

674
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,760
