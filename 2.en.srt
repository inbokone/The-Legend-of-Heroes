=Episode 2=

3
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,870
Nianci!

4
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,410
Give it to me!

5
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,530
Silly girl, what are you doing?

6
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,500
It's not right.

7
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,330
Bumpkin,

8
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,140
how should I do it correctly?

9
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,550
What a bumpin.

10
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,580
A rube!

11
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,890
You should marry this girl.

12
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,660
What if I don't?

13
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,620
Then why did you

14
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,380
have a duel with her?

15
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,040
It clearly says so right here.

16
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,220
Martial Duel for a Spouse.

17
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,290
So, you're meddling in our issue?

18
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,970
What do you want?

19
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,100
You marry this girl

20
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,970
or give her shoe back.

21
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,280
Do you fall for this girl

22
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,460
or what?

23
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,810
It's not like that.

24
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,460
Give her the shoe.

25
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,880
Fine,

26
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,990
I'll return it.

27
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,990
Young man,

28
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:53,990
forget it.

29
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,520
We don't have to

30
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,460
stoop to his level.

31
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,620
How could you

32
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,640
sneak attack like that?

33
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,970
All's fair in war, okay?

34
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,520
You think everyone is

35
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,500
as foolish as you?

36
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,870
With your limited skills,

37
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,010
you dare to defend her?

38
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,520
Go back and ask your master's wife

39
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,460
to teach you for 20 more years.

40
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,730
My master doesn't have a wife.

41
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,960
Then have your master

42
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,060
get married.

43
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,860
(Peng Lianhu)
Rinpoche,

44
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,780
let's chase that guy off.

45
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,460
(Rinpoche Lingzhi)
Don't rush.

46
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,660
Let His Highness play longer.

47
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,860
(Hou Tonghai)

48
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,380
(Liang Ziweng)
You're a master of human nature.

49
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,710
Don't worry.

50
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,550
He's no match for His Highness.

51
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,180
Let's see how His Highness
will play a trick on him.

52
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,460
Yes, let's have a look.

53
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,200
Young man,

54
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,570
we don't want that shoe.

55
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,270
Don't argue with him.

56
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,200
Let's go.

57
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,100
Mr. Mu,

58
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,460
this is too unreasonable. This can't happen.

59
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,430
Stop!

60
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,110
Stop!

61
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:24,880
You can't leave.

62
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,820
What's your problem?

63
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,700
We'll have a problem

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,100
if you don't return the shoe.

65
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,780
Is this girl your sister?

66
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,610
Do you want to be my brother-in-law?

67
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,170
I don't even know her.

68
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,970
You can't be so unreasonable.

69
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,170
You'll get yourself killed.

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,830
Who is His Highness fighting with?

71
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,080
This way up ahead?

72
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,200
His Highness is ahead.

74
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,220
Let's hurry over.

75
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,840
Be careful.

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,190
(Wang Chuyi, one of 7 Immortals of Quanzhen)
He looks like a Taosit.

77
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,140
(Could he be from Quanzhen School
of Zhongnan Mountain?)

78
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,460
(That would be troublesome.)

79
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,580
Boy, please calm down.

80
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,580
You Taoist!

81
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,660
Do you want to die?

82
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,540
Dare to meddle in our prince's affairs?

83
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,460
Take this!

84
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,300
I've never met

85
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,500
this young man.

86
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,900
But I respect his bravery

87
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,180
in acting on justice

88
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,260
just now.

89
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,980
Please spare him

90
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,620
and let him go.

91
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,540
What's your name?

92
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,580
And who's

93
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,380
your master?

94
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,100
I'm Wanyan Kang.

95
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,500
But you don't deserve to know

96
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,180
my master's name.

97
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,500
Did your master say anything

98
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,740
when he taught you martial arts?

99
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,660
(Looks like he is indeed)

100
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,660
(from Zhongnan Mountain.)

101
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,740
(I can't let him know my identity.)

102
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,820
(Before he reveals his identity,)

103
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,820
(I must deal with him.)

104
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,060
(So he won't talk all about this)

105
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,420
(to my master.)

106
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,780
What my master told me

107
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,100
is none of your business.

108
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,500
You're a martial arts senior

109
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,100
but you bullied a junior.

110
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,100
Are you humiliating me I have no helpers here?

111
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,620
The princess is here!

112
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,020
Wanyan Kang!

113
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,020
You can't leave!

114
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,340
Boy, let's go.

115
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,180
What?

116
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,580
Go.

117
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,380
Mother.

118
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,470
Why are you fighting

119
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,380
out of nowhere?

120
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,060
- (Xiruo?)
- I practiced martial arts here

121
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,220
to keep fit.

122
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,180
I met a master and learned

123
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,300
some moves from him,

124
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,140
not fighting.

125
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,980
Stop fooling around.

126
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,140
Come back home with me.

127
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,900
Yes, Mother.

128
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,460
(All of this)

129
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,340
(started 18 years ago)

130
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,740
(in Niujia Village.)

131
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,020
(It was a winter night.)

132
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,660
(My sworn brother Guo Xiaotian and I)

133
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,740
(went hunting.)

134
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,860
(Qiu Chuji, one of Seven Immortals of Quanzhen)

135
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,420
Brave men, you've been
watching this for a while.

136
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,900
Please show yourselves!

137
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,940
(Guo Xiaotian)

138
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,340
(Yang Tiexin)

139
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,620
Murderous Taoist!

140
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,100
What do you want?

141
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,620
You search them.

142
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,380
This writing...

143
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,620
They're Jin soldiers?

144
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,820
May I ask your name?

145
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,060
I am Qiu Chuji.

146
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,100
We're fortunate

147
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,580
to meet you,Taoist.

148
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,820
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

149
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,900
The wine's good.

150
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,420
Here.

151
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,980
Both of our wives

152
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,020
are pregnant.

153
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,500
Could you name the babies

154
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,940
for us?

155
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,180
Guo's child will be Guo Jing.

156
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,940
Yang's child will be

157
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,100
Yang Kang.

158
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,580
No matter their gender,

159
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,980
these names will work.

160
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,300
Good.

161
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,620
Do you want them

162
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,100
to remember the Jingkang Incident

163
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,180
and the shame

164
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,100
of two emperors being captured?

165
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,820
Exactly.

166
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,500
I'll give

167
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,740
this pair of daggar for the unborn babies.

168
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,900
You can exchange them

169
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,380
(Guo Jing)
as a symbol of the Guo

170
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,020
and the Yang's friendship.

171
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,900
If we both

172
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,740
have sons,

173
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,540
they'll be sworn brothers.

174
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,460
If we both have daughters,

175
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,620
they'll be sworn sisters.

176
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,060
If they are of opposite sexes,

177
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,780
they'll be married.

178
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,580
(Li Ping, Guo Xiaotian's wife)
(Bao Xiruo, Yang Tiexin's wife)

179
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,020
Cheers!

180
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,260
I'm Duan Tiande, here by royal decree

181
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,900
to capture rebels

182
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,580
Guo Xiaotian and Yang Tiexin.

183
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,420
Get out

184
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,160
(Duan Tiande)
and surrender!

185
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,620
What crime have we committed?

186
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,900
Why do you capture us?

187
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,260
You are guilty.

188
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,820
That's enough!

189
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,540
Big brother,

190
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,940
let's fight our way out!

191
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,780
Big brother!

192
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,300
We're doomed today.

193
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,140
Go save Xiruo

194
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,260
and Ping.

195
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,540
I'll hold them off.

196
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,580
I'll go with you.

197
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,100
Take care of my wife and child.

198
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,340
See you in the next life.

199
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,220
Go!

200
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,500
Go!

201
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,700
Don't worry.

202
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,180
I'll find Sister Ping

203
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,820
and come for you.

204
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,420
Please be careful!

205
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,220
Our child and I can't

206
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,500
live without you.

207
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,660
Xiaotian!

208
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,300
Xiaotian!

209
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,500
Let me go!

210
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,500
- Be quick!
- Let me go!

211
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,820
Brother Yang!

212
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,660
Let her go!

213
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,340
I'll spare your lives!

214
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,820
I doubt

215
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,860
that you will be spared.

216
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,860
My leader asked me not to let anyone go.

217
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,740
If I let you go,

218
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,100
how can I report to him?

219
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,140
Get him!

220
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,380
Arrows!

221
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,580
(I survived)

222
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,460
(to find Sister Ping)

223
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,580
(and to reunite with my wife and child.)

224
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,340
Buns!

225
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,420
(West Market)

226
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,940
Who called the princess?

227
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,140
Her Royal Highness worries

228
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,540
about the Your Highness causing trouble

229
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,420
and being scolded by Sixth Prince.

230
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,900
You all always talk big

231
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,180
but can't even handle a Taoist

232
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,900
and a country bumpkin.

233
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,620
Rouge.

234
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,280
- Father asked you to come.
- Have a look.

235
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,660
So please,

236
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,140
put in more effort.

237
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,300
Your Highness, calm down.

238
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,300
That Taoist may

239
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,620
have the upper hand.

240
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,220
But I think he won't feel well.

241
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,940
Taoist!

242
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,740
Go find

243
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,380
a secluded inn

244
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,100
and carry me there.

245
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,180
Sure. No problem.

246
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,260
Stop!

247
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,380
Who are you?

248
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,620
You brat!

249
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,420
We've met at the duel.

250
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,300
Don't you remember us?

251
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,900
No, I don't.

252
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,820
You brat.

253
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,900
I'll leave you with a good memory then.

254
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,140
In the martial world,

255
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,220
we are the famous

256
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,340
Four Devils of the Yellow River!

257
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,980
I'm Shen Qinggang, Soul-Severing Saber!

258
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,140
I'm Wu Qinglie, Life-Chasing Spear!

259
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,700
I'm Ma Qingxiong, Soul-Capturing Whip!

260
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,460
I'm Qian Qingjian, Death's Axe!

261
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,300
What nonsense are you talking about?

262
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,980
You're just bullies

263
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,990
and taking advantage of people.

264
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,980
Stay out of my way.

265
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,300
My host

266
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,620
wants to meet you in his house.

267
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,940
No more talking.

268
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,500
Capture them

269
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,020
and claim our reward!

270
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,220
I'll try my best.

271
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,740
You can't hurt Taoist.

272
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,580
Go!

273
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,620
Ouch!

274
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,780
Who fights dirty?

275
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,660
Who's behind these sneak attacks?

276
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,860
Ouch! Ouch!

277
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,700
Stop looking.

278
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,620
Run!

279
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,300
Brother Huang?

280
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,060
You brought a helper?

281
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,020
Watch out, Brother Huang!

282
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,420
There he is! Get him!

283
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,260
Go!

284
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,340
Brother Huang,

285
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,420
you're skilled.

286
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,100
Don't worry. They can't hurt me.

287
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,420
Thank you for your help.

288
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,700
Taoist.

289
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,780
Stop right here.

290
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,380
Or I'll give you more tiles.

291
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,540
Why are you still standing here?

292
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,560
We must teach that brat a lesson

293
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,580
for good!

294
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,100
- Go!
- Get him!

295
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,940
Go!

296
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,620
This way, Taoist.

297
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,340
How do you feel?

298
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,220
Find a vat.

299
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,580
Fill it with water.

300
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,780
- OK.
- Be quick.

301
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,620
Okay.

302
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,420
Here, Taoist.

303
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,460
Good boy.

304
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,980
Don't let anyone in.

305
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,820
Okay.

306
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,500
Here. Taoist, slowly.

307
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,740
Taoist.

308
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,340
How do you feel?

309
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,900
A bit better.

310
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,380
That Tibetan monk's skill

311
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,820
is poisonous.

312
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,900
The monk's hand

313
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,860
is poisonous?

314
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,500
Yes.

315
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,660
I've seen many kinds of

316
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,620
poison palm skills.

317
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,420
But this one is the worst

318
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,940
that I've seen.

319
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,180
Today,

320
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,700
I almost died.

321
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,340
Luckily, you're fine now.

322
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,060
Taoist,

323
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,940
do you want some food?

324
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,100
I'll go get some.

325
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,220
No need.

326
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,700
You go get

327
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,980
paper and ink for me.

328
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,020
I'll write a prescription.

329
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,700
Though I'm fine now.

330
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,420
The internal poison remains.

331
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,140
If not treated

332
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,140
in 24 hours,

333
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,740
I'll be disabled for life.

334
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,700
Shopkeeper,

335
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,180
I want these herbs.

336
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,860
I'm sorry.

337
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,660
We just sold out

338
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,340
these herbs.

339
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,100
Please give me these.

340
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,940
We used to had plenty

341
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,540
of blood resin and panax notoginseng.

342
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,180
But someone bought them all just now.

343
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,580
If you want to get them quickly,

344
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,940
please try other pharmacies.

345
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,220
(Baicaotang Pharmacy)

346
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,060
Look.

347
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,460
Do you have these herbs?

348
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,540
Taoist,

349
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,820
how do you feel?

350
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,700
Thank you.

351
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,180
People in the Prince Zhao's Mansion
are ruthless.

352
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,420
They expected

353
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,780
you'd need these herbs

354
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,900
after being poisoned.

355
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,900
So they bought

356
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,420
all of these herbs

357
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,660
from every pharmacy

358
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,580
in the city.

359
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,580
Taoist, you got hurt saving me.

360
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,220
I feel guilty.

361
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,220
My senior Ma Yu

362
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,260
told me

363
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,940
you have a chivalrous heart.

364
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,940
Now,

365
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,100
I can confirm it.

366
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,580
Taoist Ma Yu is your senior?

367
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,140
Death happens.

368
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,940
I'm willing to die

369
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,100
for you.

370
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,940
No, Taoist.

371
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,700
You won't die.

372
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,460
Maybe this is

373
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,420
a destined trouble in my fate.

374
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,140
I can't get the herbs here.

375
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,140
But I can go to another city.

376
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,380
No need.

377
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,180
Since they've tried

378
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,020
awafully hard,

379
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,580
they must've thought

380
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,980
of everything that we have.

381
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,220
We must try.

382
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,940
Please hold on.

383
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,780
I'll go now.

384
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,220
Sir, your letter.

385
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,380
Thank you.

386
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,860
(To Brother Guo)

387
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,930
(Big brother, I'll be waiting for you
by the lake 10 lis west of the city.)

388
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,860
(I know you have an emergency.
I can help you. Come!)

389
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,500
Taoist.

390
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,060
It's Brother Huang.

391
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,420
He has a plan.

392
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,420
Is your Brother Huang

393
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,540
the one who helped us

394
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,620
in the alley?

395
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,820
Yes.

396
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,140
He's smarter than me.

397
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,180
He must come up with something.

398
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,500
I'll go find him.

399
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,660
You should

400
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,900
be careful this time.

401
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,020
Brother Huang's skill

402
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,260
is beyond yours.

403
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,220
His figure and moves

404
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,740
seem kind of evil.

405
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,900
Taoist, don't worry.

406
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,820
Brother Huang won't harm me.

407
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,820
Alright, you can go.

408
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,780
Young people are all like this.

409
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,620
They can't know about something
unless they experience it.

410
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,180
And...

411
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,980
What's wrong?

412
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,420
Can't you really

413
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,940
see something from that person's

414
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,940
figure and sound?

415
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,020
No, I can't.

416
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,580
Taoist, I trust him.

417
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,700
Don't worry. Have some rest.

418
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,700
I'll go get

419
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,980
these herbs for you.

420
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,780
Here you are.

421
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,460
Thank you.

422
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,740
Take care.

423
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,260
Shopkeeper.

424
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,820
A bag of pastries, please.

425
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,700
Okay.

426
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,220
Why didn't you stop him?

427
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,180
What do you mean?

428
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,620
It's obviously your fault.

429
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,020
It's all your fault.

430
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,620
Now you're the one to talk.

431
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,980
What did you do?

432
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,340
Isn't it all your fault?

433
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,980
Now we are down to this.

434
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,060
Stop relishing your seniority!

435
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,980
If it weren't for you,

436
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,740
could the four of us not handle him alone?

437
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,740
You two! Stop that!

438
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,100
So embarrassing!

439
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,020
Who said you would give him a good lesson?

440
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,720
Look at you, hanging up there like ghosts.

441
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,580
That brat played dirty.

442
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,340
Third Brother, bite my rope and get me down!

443
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,020
- Bite it. With your teeth!
- You...

444
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,300
I can't reach it.

445
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,740
I don't want to point you.

446
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,590
He attacked my vital point.

447
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,540
You two, stop that.

448
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,180
Hey!

449
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,860
Hey, you! Help us.

450
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,900
Untie us!

451
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,580
Hurry up! Quickly! Quickly!

452
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,580
- Let me down!
- We are Four Devils of the Yellow River.

453
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,540
Quick, untie us!

454
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,780
Be quick!

455
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,620
What do you want?

456
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,100
What are you doing?

457
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,740
Don't hit me!

458
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,980
Not the face.

459
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,980
Sir, no!

460
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,820
You'd better stop.

461
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,540
What kind of martial arts are you doing now?

462
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,180
Are you kidding me?

463
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,100
Let me down!

464
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,140
I'll give you a good beating.

465
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,140
Then come down on your own.

466
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,980
You brat. I...

467
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,580
Come here. Release my vital point.

468
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,430
Let's fight one-on-one.

469
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,460
I'll give you a good beating.

470
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,700
Then release it on your own.

471
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,540
Of course I can.

472
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,900
I... I'll spit in your face.

473
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,780
Spit now.

474
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,620
Spit on him.

475
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,940
Spit in your face!

476
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,060
You are disgusting.

477
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,180
Jing!

478
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,860
- Who's that?
- Who's that?

479
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,060
- I can't see.
- Who?

480
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,700
- Who's that?
- Is that...

481
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,540
Don't go! Don't go!

482
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,980
Jing!

483
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,500
What's wrong?

484
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,460
Don't you recognize me?

485
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,660
I'm your Brother Huang.

486
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,060
You...

487
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,940
You really are my brother Huang?

488
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,100
I'm a woman.

489
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,420
It's you who calls me

490
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,420
Brother Huang.

491
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,580
Jing,

492
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,860
come aboard.

493
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,460
Brother Huang,

494
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,100
I'm a fool.

495
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,500
I thought you were a man.

496
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,860
Can't call you Brother Huang anymore.

497
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,500
Then don't call me Sister Huang either.

498
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,860
Call me Rong.

499
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,780
My father always calls me Rong.

500
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,860
Jing,

501
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,460
can I sing for you?

502
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,500
Maybe next time?

503
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,900
I need to get herbs for Taoist Wang.

504
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,420
Or

505
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,060
I'll go ride your red horse

506
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,780
to buy those herbs.

507
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,620
Is that okay?

508
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,700
Brother Huang.

509
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,780
I'm really in a hurry.

510
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,900
First,

511
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,860
I'm not Brother Huang.

512
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,140
Call me Rong.

513
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,460
Second,

514
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,700
that red horse is yours.

515
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,380
Would I really take it from you?

516
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,100
I just wanted

517
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:22,940
to test you.

518
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,700
Third,

519
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,060
even if you go to

520
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,180
the nearby town,

521
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,740
you might not find the herbs.

522
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,860
But...

523
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,900
Don't do that.

524
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,380
How can we not enjoy

525
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,820
such a beautiful time and scenery?

526
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,100
I'll sing for you.

527
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:46,860
♪Frost permeates the curtains by the window♪

528
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:52,260

00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:57,700

♪Yet no hint of allure graces their visage♪

537
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,540
What do you think?

538
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,300
This is Melody of an Auspicious Crane

539
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,140
by Mr. Xin.

540
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,340
It's about plum blossoms after the snow.

541
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,180
Is it nice?

542
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,500
Yes.

543
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,220
But I can't get it.

544
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,780
Who's Mr. Xin?

545
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,980
He is Xin Qiji.

546
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,340
My father said

547
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,540
he is a good official
who cared about the people.

548
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,060
After the North fell to the Jin,

549
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,500
Yue Fei and other loyal courtiers

550
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,380
were killed by traitors.

551
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,580
Only Mr. Xin

552
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,420
is working on to reclaim the lost lands.

553
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,100
I'm new to the Central Plains.

554
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,500
Can you

555
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,420
tell me these stories one by one, okay?

556
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,460
Okay.

557
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,820
I need to find a way

558
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,060
to save Taoist Wang.

559
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,780
If he doesn't take the herbal soup

560
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,100
in 24 hours,

561
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,500
he'll be disabled.

562
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,460
Listen to me.

563
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,700
Let's stay here a bit longer.

564
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,340
I promise you'll get the herbs.

565
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,380
Really?

566
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,540
Of course.

567
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,060
Don't worry, Jing.

568
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,580
Now I fear nothing.

569
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,780
Even if my father threw me out,

570
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,980
you'll let me stay with you,

571
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,380
right?

572
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,180
Of course.

573
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,660
I brought you some pastries.

574
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,340
They're smashed.

575
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,780
Can't eat.

576
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,780
Don't throw it away.

577
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,260
I love it.

578
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,220
What's wrong?

579
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,180
Rong?

580
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,980
My mother passed away when I was young.

581
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,340
No one has ever cared for me like you.

582
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,740
I'll keep it

583
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,900
and enjoy later.

584
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,780
You look so beautiful.

585
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,060
Why did you dress up like a beggar?

586
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,420
Do you think I'm beautiful?

587
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,900
Yes.

588
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,100
Like the fairy of the snowy mountains.

589
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,100
Have you seen a fairy?

590
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,580
No.

591
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,260
Who sees a fairy

592
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,420
will not live long.

593
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,300
Why?

594
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,900
Our Mongolian elders often say

595
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,820
anyone who sees a fairy

596
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,860
will be mesmerized on the snowy mountain

597
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,340
and won't go home.

598
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,820
Before long, they will freeze to death.

599
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,180
Would you be mesmerized by seeing me?

600
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,260
That's different.

601
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,140
You truly treat me well.

602
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,660
No matter if I'm a man or a woman,

603
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,140
ugly

604
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,020
or beautiful,

605
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,860
you'll always

606
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,700
treat me well.

607
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,980
Of course.

608
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,500
Dressed like this,

609
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,460
everyone would be nice to me.

610
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,500
But that's nothing special.

611
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,460
When I was a beggar,

612
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,500
you treated me well.

613
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,700
That's the real deal.

614
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,140
It's beautiful here.

615
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,940
But we have to go.

616
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,940
Where are we going?

617
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,380
Aren't you getting herbs for Taoist Wang?

618
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,780
Right.

619
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,380
But where can we get it now?

620
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,580
All the herbs have been taken

621
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,100
by people from Prince Zhao's Mansion.

622
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,380
Then let's go to the Prince Zhao's Mansion.

623
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,580
Okay.

624
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,620
I'll go.

625
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,860
But you can't go with me.

626
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,740
Why?

627
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,260
Anyway, you can't go.

628
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,580
Are you worried

629
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,460
those bad people there

630
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,500
might bully me?

631
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,620
Am I right?

632
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,220
If you are in danger,

633
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,380
what can I do by myself?

634
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,740
Alright.

635
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,060
Then let's go get the herbs together.

636
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,620
Great!

637
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,700
(Prince Zhao's Mansion)

638
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,390
Your internal martial arts are great.

639
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,660
- You too.
- Why does

640
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,660
the prince left that girl here.

641
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,780
- Go.
- What do you think?

642
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,820
That's obvious.

643
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,300
Have you seen

644
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,540
such a beautiful girl like her

645
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,660
since you were born?

646
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,780
That's true.

647
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,140
I want to see

648
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,420
what kind of beauty she is.

649
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,140
Let's go and have a look.

650
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,100
Rong, we should find the herbs.

651
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,780
Just take a look.

652
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,860
His Highness ordered us

653
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,900
to bring food for the beauty.

654
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,740
Open the door.

655
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,580
Here is the food.

656
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,540
Rong,

657
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,540
they are...

658
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,860
You...

659
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,420
We fell into your trap.

660
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,700
You can just kill us.

661
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,100
Don't pretend to please me.

662
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,180
Who has angered old Hero Mu?

663
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,660
I'll break his legs.

664
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,820
We dare not, Your Highness.

665
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,700
Get out of here.

666
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:48,940
Yes.

667
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,180
I invited you both here

668
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,980
for an important matter.

669
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,020
Please don't get me wrong.

670
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,900
You locked us up here

671
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,860
like criminals.

672
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,180
Is that hospitality?

673
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,060
I'm sorry about this.

674
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,660
But please stay here for a few days.

675
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,180
Your trickery might fool others,

676
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,980
but not me.

677
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,620
Those in power

678
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,780
are greedy and despicable.

679
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,540
Do you think I haven't seen enough of this?

680
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,540
Hero Mu,

681
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,540
your daughter is beautiful,

682
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,140
a rarity in the world.

683
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,980
I can see that.

684
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,820
How could I not like her?

685
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,340
But,

686
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,340
I'm the son of a prince.

687
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,900
We maintain strict discipline.

688
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,140
If people know

689
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,220
that I'll marry a daughter

690
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,100
of a hero from the martial world,

691
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,380
my father will blame me.

692
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,380
Even the emperor

693
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,620
may issue a decree to reprimand my father.

694
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,620
So, what do you think

695
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,100
we should do?

696
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,500
I hope

697
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,860
you can have a rest here

698
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,180
for a few days.

699
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,300
Once you recover,

700
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,940
return to your hometown

701
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,860
and wait for things to settle down.

702
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,980
After that,

703
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,780
I'll go to marry your daughter.

704
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,660
Or Hero Mu,

705
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,180
you can send your daughter here to marry me.

706
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,300
Isn't this a win-win solution?

707
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,180
So you're saying that

708
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,820
even if my daughter marries you,

709
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,900
she'll have to stay hidden for her entire life?

710
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,420
That won't happen.

711
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,300
In the future,

712
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,500
I'll invite ministers

713
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,980
to be the matchmakers.

714
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,340
I should marry your daughter

715
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,740
in a grand ceremony.

716
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,420
Ask your mother to come here.

717
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,140
I want to talk to her in person.

718
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:43,980
No, I can't.

719
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,860
If she doesn't come to see me,

720
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,860
I won't trust you,

721
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,420
no matter what you say.

722
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,140
Hero Mu,

723
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,660
please consider it carefully.

724
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,380
I'll take my leave now.

725
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,060
