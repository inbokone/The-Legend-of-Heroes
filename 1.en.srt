1
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,510
Do you surrender?

2
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,510
Do you surrender?

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,270
(Young Guo Jing)
No! I won't!

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,800
I won't surrender! Never!

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,190
Pull him up! Kowtow to me!

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,620
(Young Tolui)
Guo Jing, run! Don't mind me!

7
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,670
Stay away, all of you!

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,840
Guo Jing,

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,710
(Young Dushi)
I'm dealing with Tolui. Why do you care?

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If you dare hurt him,

11
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,200
I'll kill you!

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,200
(Ke Zhen'e, nicknamed Flying Bat,
from Seven Freaks of Jiangnan)

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,110
This dagger

14
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,750
is yours?

15
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,070
Your surname is Yang?

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,240
No, it's Guo.

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,350
Kid, what's your mother's name?

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,840
My mother's Li Ping.

19
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,270
And your father?

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,790
My father's Guo Xiaotian.

21
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,000
Kid, we've been searching for you
for six years.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,550
(Quan Jinfa, nicknamed Hidden Hero)
We want to find you,

23
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,880
(Nan Xiren, nicknamed Southern Hill Woodcutter)

24
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,680
(Han Xiaoying, nicknamed Yue Maiden Sword)
teach you martial arts

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,500
(Zhang Asheng, nicknamed Laughing Buddha)
and help you seek revenge.

26
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,330
(Zhu Cong, nicknamed Marvellous-Handed Scholar)
What do you think?

27
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,100
(Han Baoju, nicknamed Horse Deity,
from Seven Freaks of Jiangnan)

28
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,990
I agree. I want to become powerful

29
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,970
to avenge my father.

30
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,120
Seven masters,

31
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,350
please accept my kowtou.

32
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,400
(From that day on,)

33
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,000
(I became a disciple
of Seven Heroes of Jiangnan.)

34
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,600
(That year,)

35
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,230
(the martial world was rife with killings.)

36
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,000
(The evil Twin Killers in the Dark Wind)

37
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,820
(Mei Chaofeng)
(also came to the desert.)

38
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,950
(Chen Xuanfeng)
(They held me hostage)

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,840
(for killing my masters.)

40
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,120
(Maybe I was young and fearless,)

41
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,840
(in that big battle,)

42
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,070
(I accidentally stabbed)

43
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,590
(Copper Corpse Chen Xuanfeng's
vulnerable area.)

44
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,680
(And he died.)

45
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,230
(Iron Corpse Mei Chaofeng
turned blind and escaped.)

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,880
(Asheng's tomb. Wife Hanxiaoying)
(But my fifth master Zhang Asheng)

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,240
(died in the chaotic battlefield.)

48
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,430
Jing, rise up.

49
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,960
Fifth Master died saving me,

50
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,000
I feel bad.

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,150
We live and die in the martial world.

52
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,190
This is our fate.

53
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,680
Your Fifth Master fought for justice.

54
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,710
He died a worthy death.

55
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,120
You must diligently practice martial arts,

56
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,120
and master our martial arts.

57
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,310
Then your master can rest his soul.

58
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,080
Disciple will not disappoint

59
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,310
masters' expectations!

60
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,430
(From then on,)

61
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,840
(I learned martial arts from my six masters.)

62
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,000
(such as fist position, swordsmanship,
assassination weapons, and inner energy.)

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,870
(They taught me everything.)

64
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,990
(But...)

65
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,590
Jing is not talented in martial arts.

66
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,680
We taught him ten moves.

67
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,520
He can learn at most one.

68
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,800
That boy Jing

69
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,310
is really...

70
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,400
Big brother,

71
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,680
maybe we should send this boy

72
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,590
back to that cow-nosed bun Taoist.

73
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,560
We just admit defeat

74
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,000
in that bet, okay?

75
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,680
If that's the case,

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,310
won't my Fifth Brother's death be in vain?

77
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,360
We made a vow back then.

78
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,360
Now we're giving up halfway.

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,840
How can we face the Central Plains again?

80
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,120
Don't lose heart.

81
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,310
Though Jing is not gifted,

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,560
he is obedient and hardworking.

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,310
- Heaven rewards diligence.
- Punch hard.

84
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,750
- He has the potential.
- Stand still.

85
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,080
- Exactly.
- Good. Again.

86
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,630
We Seven Freaks of Jiangnan

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,430
always keep our promises.

88
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,870
We never back down!

89
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,700
(Guo Jing)

90
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,380
=The Legend of Heroes=

91
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,300
=Hot Blooded=

92
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,340
=Episode 1=

93
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,150
Got beaten again.

94
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,150
How did practice?

95
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,040
Your palm strength is so weak.

96
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,070
Second Brother, you hit too hard.

97
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,240
This is a letter from the Zhongnan Mountain.

98
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,670
What's it say?

99
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,000
It says Qiu Chuji

100
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,920
found a Yang Tiexin's descendant

101
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,510
and taken him as a disciple.

102
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,040
He mentioned the upcoming

103
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,630
Jiaxing Martial Arts Duel two years later.

104
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,800
Seems he's very confident.

105
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,880
Jing's martial arts

106
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,430
hasn't improved much
in the past couple of decades.

107
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,070
The duel is approaching,

108
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,270
Jing may not be able to win.

109
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,630
What if he gets injured?

110
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,600
How can we tell his mother?

111
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
(My masters said,)

112
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,720
(when I turn 18,)

113
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,630
(I must go to Jiangnan to duel with someone.)

114
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,870
(He is my sworn brother)

115
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,560
(named Yang Kang.)

116
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,120
It won't work

117
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,120
even if you practice for a hundred years!

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,840
Excuse me?

119
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,120
Watch this.

120
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,240
May I ask who you are?

121
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,110
Your masters

122
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,160
are all top martial artists.

123
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,640
These past ten years,

124
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
they've surely trained you meticulously

125
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,070
without holding back.

126
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,440
But your progress remains minimal.

127
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,670
Do you know

128
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,670
the reason?

129
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,480
Because I'm stupid.

130
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,320
Masters teach me everything,

131
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,440
but I can't learn.

132
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
I doubt that.

133
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,200
But

134
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,960
they teach without mastering the method,

135
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,270
and you learn without grasping the essence.

136
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,440
Your seven masters

137
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,630
made a private agreement with my junior

138
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
Qiu Chuji.

139
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,240
If I teach you privately,

140
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,270
it would be unfair.

141
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,920
But

142
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,960
we are lucky to meet.

143
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,910
I'll teach you something

144
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,240
about breathing, walking,

145
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,870
and sleeping.

146
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,150
I have four sayings.

147
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,200
You must remember them.

148
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,000
"Clear heart, emotions departed,

149
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,550
in empty body Qi can spread.

150
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,270
A dead mind, yet the spirit lives,

151
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,240
for Yin thrives but the Yang is shed."

152
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,080
Clear heart, emotions departed,

153
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,200
in empty body Qi can spread.

154
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,320
A dead mind, yet the spirit lives,

155
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,440
for Yin thrives but the Yang is shed."

156
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,600
Seems Jing gets it.

157
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,960
He is progressing so rapidly.

158
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,440
Maybe we can win the bet.

159
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,160
Something is wrong.

160
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,270
Have you noticed that?

161
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,800
Hard to say.

162
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,110
Go test him.

163
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,280
Bold apprentice!

164
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,670
I accidentally injured Second Master.

165
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,120
Please punish me.

166
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,960
I'm annoyed with you

167
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,510
not because you hurt

168
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,390
your Second Master,

169
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,630
but because your internal martial arts.

170
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,200
Who taught you this?

171
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,840
Internal martial arts?

172
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,840
Is it the heat

173
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,270
swirling in my chest?

174
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,240
Yes, that's it.

175
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,990
Jing,

176
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,320
who taught you this?

177
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,750
Six masters.

178
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,870
These years, a senior has been instructing me

179
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,480
on sleeping

180
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,390
and breathing.

181
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,080
But

182
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,150
he hasn't taught me

183
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,080
any moves.

184
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,440
He also said,

185
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,120
he might be

186
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,080
more skilled than my masters

187
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,600
and didn't allow me to call him master.

188
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,960
Anything else about him?

189
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,510
He made me swear

190
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,390
not to describe his appearance

191
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,910
or movements to anyone.

192
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,150
Since I promised him,

193
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,440
I can't break my word.

194
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,390
Jing is right.

195
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,320
In the martial world,

196
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,410
we value loyalty and integrity.

197
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,160
You can go now.

198
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,630
Big brother?

199
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,960
Follow him.

200
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,920
- Go.
- Okay.

201
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,960
I didn't expect Jing's inner energy skillls

202
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,910
to be so impressive.

203
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,670
That mysterious person must be up there.

204
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,370
Big brother, what should we do?

205
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,280
Let's follow him and see.

206
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,510
Everyone, play things by ear.

207
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,630
Big brother.

208
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,150
It's an old acquaintance.

209
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,360
The person on the mountain

210
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,670
is Mei Chaofeng!

211
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,750
What?

212
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,440
Jing is learning

213
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,600
martial arts from that demoness?

214
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,710
I can't believe

215
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,600
our years of effort

216
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,750
have nurtured a threat.

217
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,360
Jing is loyal and honest.

218
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,840
He is not an evil person.

219
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,020
I only knew his face, not his heart.

220
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,920
How can an honest person

221
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,110
stay with such a scoundrel?

222
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,960
That's impossible.

223
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,270
Jing killed Copper Corpse Chen Xuanfeng.

224
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,300
He's that witch's husband.

225
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,320
That's the viciousness of Mei Chaofeng.

226
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,240
She must have exploited Jing's passion

227
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,080
for martial arts

228
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,080
to use him against us.

229
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,390
I'm afraid if we fall into a trap,

230
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,960
Jing might not escape either.

231
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,030
We'll be mocked forever

232
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,630
if the martial world know that

233
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,840
we've raised an ungrateful person

234
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,670
for over a decade.

235
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,510
What are you saying?

236
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,530
Tonight,

237
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,260
we'll rectify our conduct

238
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,350
and eradicate the evil completely!

239
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,270
Taoist, what's wrong?

240
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,790
Iron Corpse Mei Chaofeng.

241
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,150
Mei Chaofeng?

242
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,200
Calm down.

243
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,030
Over the past ten years,

244
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,840
this demoness perfected her

245
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
Nine Yin Skeleton Claw.

246
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,440
We might not be her match.

247
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,960
Let's wait for the right moment

248
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,590
to strike.

249
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,840
Masters.

250
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,630
Demoness,

251
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,270
we've searched for you for ten years.

252
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,670
It's your time to die!

253
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,120
I've been looking for you too.

254
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,960
Tonight, you came to me.

255
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,270
Let's settle the score.

256
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,480
Pay for my Fifth Brother's life!

257
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,840
Eradicate the evil completely!

258
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:50,950
Jing!

259
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,390
Master!

260
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,390
I'm not your master.

261
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,190
Second Master,

262
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,160
what are you doing?

263
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,480
That demoness taught you martial arts

264
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,750
to turn you against us,

265
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,750
right?

266
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,560
Traitor!

267
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,110
I'll cripple you.

268
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,790
Why are you standing still?

269
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,110
I never harm my masters.

270
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,270
Stop with the sweet talk.

271
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,720
If you can't do it,

272
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:28,950
I will.

273
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,080
Wait!

274
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
Please hold on.

275
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,110
Who are you?

276
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,000
I am Ma Yu.

277
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,400
(Ma Yu, one of Seven Immortals of Quanzhen)
I've long admired Seven Heroes of Jiangnan.

278
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,540
I have no intention of interfering

279
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,000
in your master-apprentice matters.

280
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,400
But I'm lucky to get acquainted with Guo Jing.

281
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,350
There might be some misunderstanding.

282
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,510
Did you teach Jing

283
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,390
internal martial arts?

284
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,400
Exctly.

285
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,000
I taught him without

286
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,040
Seven Heroes' permission.

287
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,000
I apologize.

288
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,240
Come help!

289
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,720
Master!

290
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,750
So you are a Taoist from Zhongnan Mountain.

291
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,550
Shame on your reputable sect.

292
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,920
You're just picking on the minority.

293
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,310
Leaving a demoness like you

294
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,590
will only harm the martial world.

295
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,240
Everyone wants you dead!

296
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,880
The road ahead is long.

297
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,510
I'll fight you to the death!

298
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,840
Stop.

299
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,320
Jing,

300
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,270
you will go to the duel alone

301
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,070
this time.

302
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,880
Masters, won't you

303
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,960
come with me?

304
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,070
Mei Chaofeng just escaped.

305
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,510
Recently,

306
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,240
she has been appearing in the desert.

307
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,640
We want to find her

308
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,920
while she's still injured

309
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,270
and eradicate the evil completely!

310
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,440
Masters, please be careful.

311
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,240
I'll try my best and won't make you

312
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,080
lose faces.

313
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,510
You'll travel alone.

314
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,350
No master

315
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,000
can teach you this experience.

316
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,680
Remember my words:

317
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,960
if you can't win, just run.

318
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,760
Yes.

319
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,760
Jing,

320
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,880
don't forget.

321
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,750
By noon on March 24th,

322
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,550
you must make it to Zuixian Restaurant

323
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,510
in Jiaxing Prefecture.

324
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,160
No matter what,

325
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,430
don't miss it.

326
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,720
Yes, Master.

327
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,480
It's noon on March 24th,

328
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,510
at Zuixian Restaurant in Jiaxing.

329
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,880
We'll come find you after we're done

330
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,270
dealing with the demoness.

331
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,320
Yes, Master.

332
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,790
(Changqing Restaurant)
Stop! Stop!

333
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,240
Don't run!

334
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,670
Stop!

335
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,040
- Stop!
- Don't run!

336
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,800
Stop!

337
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,190
Stop!

338
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,820
(Huang Rong)

339
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,550
Buns!

340
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,310
Fresh buns!

341
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,720
Get your pendant.

342
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,560
Have a look!

343
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,030
Great! Great!

344
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,960
Who are this stinky beggar?

345
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,750
Dare to steal from us?

346
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,800
You want them?

347
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,800
Here you go.

348
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,310
You ruined our steamed buns!

349
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,480
How can we sell them?

350
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,430
Hit him!

351
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,080
Don't be rude.

352
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,440
What? You want to fight?

353
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,110
No.

354
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,270
I'll pay for the buns.

355
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,110
Is it enough?

356
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,350
Alright.

357
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,830
Lucky for you.

358
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,350
Let's go.

359
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,630
Little brother,

360
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,760
I can

361
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,400
treat you to a good meal.

362
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,760
Great.

363
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,400
I'm bored alone.

364
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,560
Good to have a company.

365
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,400
Come on in.

366
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,000
- This way, please.
- Little brother,

367
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,880
are you from Jiangnan?
[*Jiangnan: regions south of the Yangtze River]

368
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,150
Why?

369
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,110
My mother is from Lin'an, Zhejiang.

370
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,310
My masters

371
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,920
are from Zuojin, Jiaxing.

372
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,270
That's why your accent

373
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,880
feels so...

374
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,920
- This way.
- Feels what?

375
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:06,720
I can't say it.

376
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:07,870
Is it familiar?

377
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,320
Exactly.

378
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,200
Waiter, we'll order.

379
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,240
Yes, we'll order.

380
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,390
What can you order?

381
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,240
Yeah, I will order.

382
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,880
What a snob.

383
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,280
Do you think I can't

384
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,880
afford your food?

385
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,430
Alright,

386
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,390
you can.

387
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,510
But weren't you the one

388
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,630
stealing buns?

389
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,270
Yes, he's definitely a snob.

390
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:32,870
Big brother,

391
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,790
You said you would treat me a meal.

392
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,240
- Can I order anything?
- Little brother,

393
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,390
you can order anything.

394
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,160
What good food can you order?

395
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,680
I'm afraid

396
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,270
your best dishes

397
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,280
might not suit my taste.

398
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,400
As long as you can name it,

399
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,640
we can make it.

400
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,240
But what if there's no one to pay

401
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,640
after the meal?

402
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,920
Sir, what do you want?

403
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,030
Half a jin of beef,
[*jin: a weight unit]

404
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,310
and one jin of lamb liver.

405
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,920
Little brother, want some wine?

406
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,920
Beef, lamb liver, are they good?

407
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,150
First time in the Central Plains,

408
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,750
I don't know

409
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,590
the local customs.

410
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,270
You can order some local dishes.

411
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,790
So I can taste something new.

412
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,670
Great.

413
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,800
Let's start with fruits and nuts.

414
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,670
Okay.

415
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,650
Give us four dried, four fresh,

416
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,990
two sour-salted and four preserved in honey.

417
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,920
What are you talking about?

418
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,110
In this small place,

419
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,030
I doubt you can offer really good food.

420
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,430
Four dried

421
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,670
are lychees, longans,

422
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,520
steamed dates, and ginkgo nuts.

423
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,110
And give us whatever's in season.

424
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,760
We also want sliced,

425
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,680
perfumed sour cherries

426
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,770
and sour plums with ginger.

427
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,110
Quite specific.

428
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,680
These are just the basics.

429
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,350
I don't want to trouble you.

430
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:44,000
Since you don't have fresh fish or shrimp here,

431
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,160
give us eight main dishes

432
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,750
that are still good.

433
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,790
What do you want then?

434
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:49,870
Listen up. They are

435
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,240
steamed quail,

436
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,910
fried duck webs, chicken tongue soup,

437
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,830
deer stomach with scallops,

438
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,800
pan-fried beef tendons,

439
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,920
rabbit shreds with chrysanthemum,

440
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,690
deep-fried deer legs,

441
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,680
and gold and silver hooves
with ginger and vinegar.

442
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,960
I just ordered what you can cook.

443
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,680
As for expensive dishes,

444
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,160
I don't think you can make them.

445
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,550
These eight dishes

446
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:08,830
cost a lot.

447
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,480
Just the duck webs and chicken tongue soup

448
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,720
need dozens of ducks

449
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,590
and chickens.

450
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,720
Well...

451
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,350
This gentleman will pay.

452
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,110
Do you think he can't afford it?

453
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,200
Well...

454
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,670
Is it enough?

455
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,540
Yes. Yes.

456
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,550
I'll go prepare now.

457
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,030
Do you need anything else?

458
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
Eight dim sum dishes. That's enough.

459
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,640
What wine do you want?

460
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,560
What do you have?

461
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,310
We have ten-year-old

462
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,190
Sanbai Fen wine.

463
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,640
How about two bottles?

464
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,590
That's not bad.

465
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,720
Okay.

466
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,590
Great.

467
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,760
Please wait a moment.

468
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,870
You took too much.

469
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,030
No, I didn't.

470
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,760
Keep it.

471
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,910
You gave him too much.

472
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,920
Actually, I have more.

473
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,590
I've never

474
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,480
seen such delicacies.

475
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,880
You've never been to Jiangnan?

476
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,790
An old saying goes,

477
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,240
"In Wu and Yue,

478
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,320
missing someone in dreams.

479
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,240
Transparent tiles gleam over endless waves;

480
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,070
A black awning boat
carries the essence of spring.

481
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,590
In water towns, my soul finds repose."

482
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,880
This is Jiangnan.

483
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,440
Though I don't quite understand,

484
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,510
it sounds beautiful.

485
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,070
- Waiter!
- Coming!

486
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,040
Come here.

487
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,520
Yes, sir?

488
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,200
Your scallops are five years old.

489
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
How can you serve this?

490
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,110
I don't know that...

491
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,920
Sir, I'm the manager.

492
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:44,960
You got it right,

493
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,480
indeed.

494
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,240
I apologize.

495
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,880
Actually, we don't serve scallops.

496
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,440
These were just bought

497
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,550
from the biggest restaurant here.

498
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,680
Then take them away.

499
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,810
- Quickly, take them away.
- Take them away.

500
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,080
Let's go on.

501
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,000
Here.

502
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,520
I'll use this one.

503
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,080
Okay.

504
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,310
Little brother, cheers.

505
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,240
Delicious.

506
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,560
Here.

507
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,660
(Changqing Restaurant)

508
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,270
Have some of this.

509
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,110
Big brother,

510
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:43,950
what are you looking at?

511
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,000
Little brother,

512
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,030
your skin is fair.

513
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,510
Why make yourself dirty?

514
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,830
We've been talking for too long.

515
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,960
The food is cold.

516
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,350
It doesn't matter.

517
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,280
We can still eat them.

518
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,670
Not tasty anymore.

519
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,400
- Waiter!
- Yes?

520
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,440
Remove these

521
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,480
cold dishes

522
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,590
and make a new set of dishes.

523
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,110
Clear the table!

524
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,550
Come, help clear the table.

525
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,630
Clear the table!

526
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,620
(Changqing Restaurant)

527
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,950
Big brother,

528
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,520
thank you. Goodbye.

529
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,720
Hold on.

530
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,910
Little brother,

531
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,030
we really hit it off.

532
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,680
You're underdressed.

533
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,720
You can keep

534
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,630
my mink coat.

535
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,520
Also,

536
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,670
here's some money.

537
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,590
Here you are.

538
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:39,910
Take it.

539
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,830
Don't take others' buns.

540
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,150
Bye.

541
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:02,950
Let's go.

542
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,110
Big brother.

543
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,840
Little brother, what's wrong?

544
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,720
May I know your name?

545
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,670
Oh, I forgot that.

546
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
My name is Guo Jing.

547
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,190
And you?

548
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,840
My family name is Huang,

549
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,720
given name Rong.

550
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,240
Brother Huang.

551
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,200
Are you going back south?

552
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,750
If so,

553
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,200
let's travel together.

554
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,040
I'm not going back.

555
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,790
Why not go home?

556
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,590
My father threw me out.

557
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,480
How could that be?

558
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,110
He imprisoned a man,

559
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,840
and wouldn't release him.

560
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,160
I felt sorry for him

561
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,110
and worried he might be bored,

562
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,720
so I brought him food and wine

563
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,080
and talked to him.

564
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,520
My father found out

565
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,560
and scolded me,

566
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,680
so I ran away at night.

567
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,480
How long have you been away?

568
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,430
Over a month.

569
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,680
By now, your father

570
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,920
must be missing you.

571
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,240
What about your mother?

572
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,630
She died long ago.

573
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,680
I grew up without my mother.

574
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,790
I'm the opposite.

575
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,350
My father died early.

576
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,400
My mother raised me.

577
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,630
Who is better,

578
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,840
father or mother?

579
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,400
I don't know.

580
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,880
Anyway, just go home

581
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,720
after you've had fun.

582
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,390
He threw me out. I won't go back.

583
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,430
No.

584
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,790
Why doesn't he come for me?

585
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,510
Maybe he tried

586
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,800
but couldn't find you.

587
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,760
That's true.

588
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,240
I'll go back when I'm done playing.

589
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,080
Big brother,

590
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,590
if I ask for a treasure,

591
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,000
can you give it to me?

592
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,080
Of course. I'll give you

593
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,440
anything you want.

594
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,510
I like your fine horse.

595
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,440
You like it? It's yours.

596
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,350
Here.

597
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:56,950
Really?

598
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,110
I never lie.

599
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,350
Brother Huang, what's wrong?

600
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,840
Are you not feeling well?

601
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,750
Here. Get ready.

602
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,560
Hold on.

603
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,350
Red horse.

604
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,160
Today, I'm giving you away

605
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,920
to my good friend, Brother Huang.

606
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,310
You must behave.

607
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,750
Don't be a baby, okay?

608
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,630
Good.

609
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,240
Bye.

610
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,980
(Martial Duel for a Spouse)

611
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,510
What's new over there?

612
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:48,910
What's so lively?

613
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,000
Your Highness,

614
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,160
that's a martial duel for a spouse.

615
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,350
Martial duel for a spouse?

616
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,150
What's that?

617
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,400
A poor artist holds it

618
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,550
to marry off his daughter.

619
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,350
Whoever wins the duel

620
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,560
can marry her.

621
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,480
Interesting.

622
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,160
Let's go take a look.

623
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,030
Great! Great!

624
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,590
Amazing!

625
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,880
(Mu Nianci)
Great! Great!

626
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:22,950
Amazing!

627
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,480
Can't do it. I'll get beaten up there.

628
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,320
Give it a try.

629
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,710
I'm Mu Yi

630
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,230
from Shandong.

631
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,070
We pass here,

632
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,280
not seeking fame or fortune.

633
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,710
It's just that my daughter is not married.

634
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,710
She once made a wish

635
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,800
not for a wealthy husband,

636
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,880
but for a martial arts master.

637
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,230
Make it specific!

638
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,630
- Tell us!
- Yes.

639
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,430
If anyone

640
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,920
under 30 years old,

641
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,510
unmarried,

642
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,440
can defeat my daughter in a fight,

643
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,590
he can have my promise to marry her.

644
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,320
Make way!

645
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,280
Don't look!

646
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,240
Be quick!

647
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,600
Move!

648
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,350
Go!

649
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,070
Move aside!

650
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:24,220
(Wanyan Kang, Prince of the Jin Empire)

651
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,070
Is this duel

652
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,230
for this young lady?

653
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,150
I'm Mu.

654
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,320
How can I help you, Young Master?

655
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,840
I'd like to give it a try.

656
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Young Master is joking.

657
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,030
We are just rough folks.

658
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,000
How dare we spar with a Young Master?

659
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
Isn't anyone allowed

660
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,480
to come up and compete?

661
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,280
I like duels.

662
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,800
Miss,

663
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:50,870
fight with me.

664
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:52,550
Young Master,

665
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,400
this is not an ordinary duels and contests.

666
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,760
It concerns my daughter's marriage.

667
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,150
Please understand.

668
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,710
How long have you been

669
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,760
holding the duel?

670
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,230
Through seven rounds,

671
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,630
it's been almost half a year.

672
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,630
And no one

673
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,510
has defeated her?

674
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,280
I don't believe that.

675
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,760
I believe

676
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:15,670
either those with exceptional
martial art skills are married,

677
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,590
or they disdain fighting with my daughter.

678
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,840
Alright then,

679
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,800
since we're both martial artists,

680
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,430
I'll give it a try.

681
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,160
Young Master,

682
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,880
why force the issue?

683
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,280
Let's spar respectfully, and that's it.

684
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,840
Don't worry.

685
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,440
I will not injure

686
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,480
or hurt your daughter.

687
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,280
Miss, you just need to land one punch

688
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,510
on me to win.

689
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,200
Is that okay?

690
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,510
Martial duels

691
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,760
demand fairness.

692
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,510
- Hurry up and start!
- Yeah!

693
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,510
You two fight, get married

694
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,710
and have babies soon!

695
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,720
Miss,

696
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,120
shall we?

697
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,110
Fight, fight, fight!

698
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,840
Fight!

699
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:09,910
Father.

700
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,550
Good.

701
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,920
Good!

702
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,630
Good moves.

703
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,390
She...

704
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,280
Good! Amazing!

705
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,440
Clearly, you can defeat me,

706
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,920
but you kept holding back.

707
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:12,920
Are you looking down on me?

708
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,920
I'm not done yet. Keep going!

709
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,710
If you want to have fun with me,

710
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,470
please go away.

711
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,550
Both of us enjoy the duel.

712
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,280
How could it just be me having fun?

713
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,800
Take my move.

714
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,710
Don't step on me!

715
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,170
Marry him.

716
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,960
Great! Great!

717
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:17,510
Marry him! Marry him!

718
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,070
Marry him! Marry him!

719
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:27,590
Marry him! Marry him!

720
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,840
Give it to me!

721
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,280
Look at him.

722
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,760
Young Master,

723
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,590
may I ask your name?

724
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,670
I don't think it's necessary.

725
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,760
We live at Gaosheng Inn

726
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,720
on the West street.

727
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,960
Let's go and have a talk there.

728
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,160
Talk about what?

729
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,840
You and your daughter

730
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,440
don't take the duel seriously.

731
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:14,990
Never mind,

732
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,320
I'm going home.

733
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,320
Since you defeated my daughter,

734
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,720
I'll marry her

735
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,600
to you.

736
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,200
It's about the marriage.

737
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,510
We can't be careless.

738
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,480
We can have a fight.

739
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,720
It's fun.

740
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,760
But marry her?

741
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:30,870
I don't think so.

742
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,320
And miss didn't dodge

743
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,590
or block my palm strike.

744
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,550
It's unfair for me to win.

745
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,990
Young Master,

746
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,440
are you making jokes on us?

747
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,720
My daughter

748
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,840
cannot marry such a frivolous person.

749
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,800
Give the shoe back!

750
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,150
She gave it to me.

751
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,640
What's it to you?

752
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,400
Although I'm not marrying her,

753
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,550
I can't refuse the award.

754
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,760
One can be killed but not humiliated.

755
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,300
Father!

756
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,780
