00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,200
I owe you my life.

4
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,350
Today,

5
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,870
I'll give it back to you.

6
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,040
Then we'll be even.

7
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,350
- No!
- Mother!

8
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,310
- Xiruo!
- Mother!

9
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,760
Mother!

10
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,480
Uncle Yang!

11
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,320
Senior!

12
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,270
Mother!

13
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,070
Senior, are you okay?

14
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,240
Jing,

15
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,080
your father and I

16
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,590
made a pact long ago.

17
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,520
If we had a boy and a girl,

18
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
they'd be a married couple.

19
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,000
I have no daughter.

20
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,630
- Father...
- I cherish

21
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,870
my adopted daughter like my own.

22
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,800
Father.

23
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,470
- I'll take care of it.
- Father.

24
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,270
Brother Yang,

25
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,120
don't worry.

26
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,630
Friends,

27
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,150
thanks for bringing about this marriage.

28
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,400
I can

29
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,190
die in peace now.

30
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,520
Father...

31
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,840
Uncle Yang.

32
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,920
Xiruo.

33
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,360
Tiexin.

34
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,520
Although it is

35
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,150
18 years late,

36
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,000
we're finally together.

37
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,360
Enough.

38
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,990
Enough.

39
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,640
Mother!

40
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,400
Mother!

41
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,840
- Uncle Yang!
- Father!

42
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,910
Mother!

43
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,150
Your Royal Highness.

44
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,080
Everything is fated.

45
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,430
Let them be.

46
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,870
Come and get me.

47
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,160
- Your Highness.
- What are you doing?

48
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,030
Your Highness, watch out!

49
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,510
Give me Taoist Qiu's antidote,

50
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,510
- or I'll kill him!
- You dare?

51
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,430
You forced my parents to death,

52
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,360
why wouldn't I dare?

53
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,320
Stop.

54
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,230
I'll give it to you.

55
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,440
Here it is. Here it is.

56
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,310
I never thought you righteous school

57
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,270
would resort to threats.

58
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,360
And you're not above

59
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,680
using poison, are you?

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,840
Your Highness.

61
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,120
You are all renowned figures

62
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,630
in the martial world.

63
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,800
We're evenly matched today.

64
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,390
How about we set another date?

65
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,670
We can

66
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,190
have a proper contest then.

67
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,480
That would be best.

68
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,790
What do you propose?

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Half a year later,

70
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,190
on Mid-Autumn Festival,

71
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,360
at Zuixian Restaurant, South Lake, Jiaxing,

72
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,920
we'll admire the moon

73
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,750
and test our skills.

74
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,960
Do you dare come?

75
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,190
Why wouldn't we?

76
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,230
Fine.

77
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,040
We Seven Immortals of Quanzhen

78
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,560
will surely be there.

79
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,560
On our Seven Freaks of Jiangnan's turf,

80
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,390
you should bring more people.

81
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,630
Or don't say we bullied you then.

82
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,590
Alright.

83
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,600
That's a deal.

84
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,640
Miss Mu,

85
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,310
how did your father live

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,240
these past years?

87
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,600
Over the past ten years,

88
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,000
my father took me all over.

89
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,120
We never stayed anywhere

90
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,120
for longer than half a month.

91
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,110
He said

92
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,270
we should find a man named Guo.

93
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,710
Mr. Ke,

94
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,190
your apprentice

95
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,800
has a noble heart.

96
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,800
But my apprentice...

97
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,440
Stop!

98
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,110
Get out.

99
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,840
Master,

100
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,070
please let me light incense

101
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,960
for my mother.

102
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,000
You, a traitorous prince of Jin,

103
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,920
bullying your master
and betraying your ancestors,

104
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,390
how dare you

105
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,920
offer incense

106
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,120
to the loyal Yang couple.

107
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,720
I only want to offer incense to my mother.

108
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,070
You really think I won't kill you?

109
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,040
Jing, what are you doing?

110
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:23,380
(Bao Xiruo's Spirit Tablet)

111
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,310
Jing, let go.

112
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,910
Taoist Qiu,

113
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,110
please calm down.

114
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,840
He's done much wrong!

115
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,510
Even so,

116
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,080
he's Uncle Yang's only child.

117
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,510
Fine.

118
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,200
I won't kill him today.

119
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,150
This brat

120
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,360
still doesn't admit that his surname is Yang!

121
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,870
I've borne the name Wanyan for 18 years.

122
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,510
None of you have told me

123
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,840
Yang Tiexin is my father!

124
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,150
Now you say I'm Yang,

125
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
a Han Chinese.

126
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,600
Why should I believe you?

127
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,150
Why?

128
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,870
Jing,

129
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,790
is your hand alright?

130
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,960
This rascal!

131
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,750
He's not worth it.

132
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,590
Master,

133
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,270
he still has a conscience.

134
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,440
I believe

135
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,720
he can change.

136
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,000
Are you here to force me to be Yang too?

137
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,550
I hope you will,

138
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,630
but I won't force you.

139
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,750
Then what do you want?

140
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,720
To laugh at me?

141
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,510
Go ahead.

142
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,840
I, Wanyan...

143
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,160
No.

144
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,080
I, Yang...

145
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,910
I've lived 18 years,

146
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,870
not knowing who I am.

147
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,630
You don't need to struggle.

148
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,240
Our Yang family is loyal.

149
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,390
My foster father Yang Tiexin

150
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,360
was a real stand-up hero,

151
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,840
daring to love and hate.

152
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,120
You can't even endure this.

153
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,240
You don't have any of his blood.

154
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,600
You came here

155
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,670
just to humiliate me?

156
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,590
You did it.

157
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,550
Satisfied?

158
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,910
Why are you still here?

159
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,670
If you don't want my company,

160
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,550
just go back.

161
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,030
The snow will get heavier,

162
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,440
you'll catch a cold.

163
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,840
I came to see you for my parents.

164
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,360
They'd want you

165
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,750
to live well.

166
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,200
It's not your business.

167
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,960
Masters.

168
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,270
Your Uncle Yang's funeral

169
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,230
is done.

170
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,240
We've called you here

171
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,510
to discuss something with you.

172
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,590
What is it?

173
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,200
Your Uncle Yang's dying wish

174
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,840
was for you

175
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,240
to marry Miss Mu.

176
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,560
Do you remember?

177
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,040
Yes.

178
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,320
But I can't marry her.

179
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,750
It's the last wish of your father

180
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,390
and Uncle Yang.

181
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,870
Will you

182
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,120
go against it?

183
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,960
It’s not Jing's fault.

184
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,750
When we were in the desert,

185
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,840
we got a letter

186
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,720
from Zhongnan Mountain that Mr. Yang had a son,

187
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,080
so the betrothal

188
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,390
was void.

189
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,630
So,

190
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,200
Jing got engaged

191
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,390
in the desert.

192
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,480
Genghis Khan of Mongolia

193
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,960
appointed him as the Gold Knife Prince Consort.

194
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,870
You seek wealth and power,

195
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,480
forget your roots and show ingratitude,

196
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,240
no better than

197
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,200
Wanyan Kang!

198
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,790
I won't marry Princess Huazheng.

199
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,280
Why?

200
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,910
I see her as a sister,

201
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,990
a good friend,

202
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,120
not a wife.

203
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,280
Good boy,

204
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,490
you have your moral integrity

205
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,440
and ambition.

206
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,590
We don't have to

207
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,670
care about the Khan

208
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,670
or the princess.

209
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,150
Just follow Uncle Yang's last wish,

210
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,630
and marry Miss Mu.

211
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,510
I can't marry Miss Mu.

212
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,680
Jing,

213
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,840
tell us.

214
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,840
Is there someone else you love?

215
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,630
Who is it?

216
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,360
Jing, tell us.

217
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,390
Which girl is it?

218
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,870
Jing, tell us. Who is it?

219
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,080
It's Rong.

220
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,230
Rong?

221
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,230
Rong who?

222
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,870
It's Huang Rong.

223
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,320
The girl in white

224
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,750
at Prince Zhao's Mansion that day?

225
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,560
Exactly.

226
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,790
The girl who saved Mei Chaofeng?

227
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,560
Jing,

228
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,480
did you stop me from killing Mei Chaofeng

229
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,350
because of her?

230
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,720
I heard Mei called her junior sister

231
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,080
and her father master.

232
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,030
Isn't she Old Heretic Huang's daughter?

233
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,110
That's right.

234
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,910
You want to marry Old Heretic Huang's daughter?

235
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,600
I've never met her father.

236
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,270
I don't know who he is.

237
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,200
So, you made a private vow?

238
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,390
No, we didn't.

239
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,750
But I know my heart belongs to Rong

240
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,320
and hers to me.

241
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,840
We both know it.

242
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,840
Jing,

243
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,560
her father

244
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,870
is a cold-blooded

245
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,750
killer.

246
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:35,990
If he finds out

247
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,680
you're with his daughter secretly,

248
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,000
you'll die!

249
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,670
Mei Chaofeng has only a fraction of his skill,

250
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,960
and she's formidable.

251
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,510
If he wants to kill you,

252
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,120
who can save you?

253
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,200
Rong is nice.

254
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,790
Her father can't be so bad.

255
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,800
Nonsense!

256
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,550
Old Heretic Huang is pure evil.

257
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,440
He is bad.

258
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,710
You must swear

259
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,080
never

260
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,080
to see

261
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,440
that demoness again.

262
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,960
Swear it!

263
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,790
Never see her again！

264
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,630
Jing.

265
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,470
Sweat it.

266
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,200
- Jing.
- Say it.

267
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,040
Jing.

268
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,080
Be quick.

269
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,870
You truly treat me well.

270
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,120
No matter if I'm a man or a woman,

271
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,360
ugly or beautiful,

272
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,000
you'll always treat me well.

273
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,560
Of course.

274
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,710
Master.

275
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,630
I can't do it.

276
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,350
What?

277
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,150
Out in the world,

278
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,670
dare you defy your masters?

279
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,350
Big brother.

280
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,720
Big brother, calm down.

281
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,670
Jing, stop angering your master.

282
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,640
- Say it!
- Jing.

283
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,680
Good boy. Listen to your master.

284
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,680
Don't upset your masters.

285
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,080
Jing.

286
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
Swear it!

287
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,560
Who?

288
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,240
Why do you force him like this?

289
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,510
Shame on you.

290
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:18,950
Jing,

291
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,030
come out.

292
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,350
Rong.

293
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,640
- Jing...
- Jing!

294
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,670
Rong,

295
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,680
thay are my masters.

296
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,960
I heard them forcing you,

297
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,110
and got angry.

298
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,350
You demoness!

299
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,520
Master,

300
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,560
Rong is not a demoness.

301
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,750
If I say she is, then she is.

302
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
That's because you're blind.

303
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,200
You can't tell who's good

304
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,310
- and who's the demoness.
- You...

305
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,160
You demoness!

306
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,240
Am I right?

307
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,960
You're so old.

308
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,200
Can't you think of something new?

309
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,590
And you,

310
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,160
nonsense show-off scholar,

311
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,750
why did you insult my father

312
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,440
saying he's a cold-blooded killer?

313
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,240
I don't argue with a girl.

314
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,590
Don't be rude.

315
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,960
They're my masters.

316
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,160
Fine, I will stop.

317
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,270
Jing, come here.

318
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,750
I have a secret to tell you.

319
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:09,960
Don't go!

320
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,240
Jing,

321
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,880
come here.

322
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,000
Don't you go!

323
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,280
Jing.

324
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,130
- Jing.
- Jing.

325
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,040
Jing!

326
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,400
Jing, come here.

327
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,240
Rong!

328
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,620
Jing! Jing!

329
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,240
Rong,

330
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,790
where are we going?

331
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,110
Get out of here

332
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,750
and go far away!

333
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,920
My masters will be angry.

334
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,270
Aren't you afraid I'll be angry?

335
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,170
♪Stars and the moon over the wild expanse♪

336
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,370

Jing,

343
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,640
your masters wanted you

344
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,750
to marry Miss Mu

345
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,790
or the Mongolian princess.

346
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,390
Why did you refuse?

347
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,960
Aren't they good enough?

348
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,310
They're good.

349
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,270
But I can't marry them.

350
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,190
Why?

351
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,870
Miss Mu

352
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,310
is a beautiful

353
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,200
girl.

354
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,310
Even if you don't marry her,

355
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,070
you can also be a Gold Knife Prince Consort,

356
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,790
with riches and glory.

357
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,280
Rong,

358
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,110
just now,

359
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,000
I meant what I said

360
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,270
to my masters.

361
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,680

00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,450
♪Or lost in the dust♪

363
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,070
I only want to be with you.

I will never like anyone else.

365
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,150
Me too.

366
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,110
Rong.

367
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'll take your hand

368
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,920
and tell my masters

369
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,270
and Taoist Ma

370
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,680
that Rong is not a demoness.

371
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,720
She is...

372
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,070
She is a good,

373
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,000
good girl.

374
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,110
Just good?

375
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,800
Anything else?

376
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,480
Just good.

377
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,000
Rong,

378
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,240
no one's better than you.

379
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,550
But your masters hate me.

380
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,110
That won't help.

381
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,790
Don't go back.

382
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,960
Let's live in the mountains,

383
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,840
on an island,

384
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,830
where they can't find us.

385
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,870
We can live there forever.

386
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,110
But we've done nothing wrong.

387
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,480
Why do we need to hide?

388
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,480
They'll tear us apart.

389
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,110
If we go back,

390
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,790
we won't see each other anymore.

391
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,320
No, Rong.

392
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,560
I'd rather die

393
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,310
than be apart from you.

394
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,840
Good.

395
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,000
We'll never be apart.

396
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,790
With your words,

397
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,680
I won't be afraid

398
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,630
of your masters.

399
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,950
So,

400
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,150
Rong,

401
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,720
let's go find my masters.

402
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,110
Then I'll go talk to Miss Mu

403
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,350
then go to the desert
to break off the engagement.

404
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,240
Great.

405
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,920
I'll follow your lead.

406
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:00,950
Masters!

407
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,080
Masters!

408
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,310
My masters must be angry with me

409
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,240
and left.

410
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,280
Jing,

411
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,190
don't worry.

412
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,190
Remember?

413
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,550
Your masters had a date with Wanyan Honglie.

414
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,750
They'll meet at the Zuixian Restaurant
in Jiaxing half a year later.

415
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,110
We can go there to meet them.

416
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,750
We'll say something nice,

417
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,880
and they won't be mad.

418
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,160
I guess that's all we can do.

419
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:39,060
(18 years ago)

420
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,350
(Ge Hill by the West Lake)

421
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,200
(is a sacred place of Taoism
where Ge Hong practiced alchemy)

422
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,080
(during the Jin Dynasty.)

423
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,480
(18 years ago,)

424
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,430
(I was sent here by my senior Ma Yu)

425
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,030
(to study Taoist scriptures)

426
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,510
(and cultivate my character)

427
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,720
(because of my heavy hostility.)

428
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,240
(But then, I heard tragic news.)

429
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,000
Master, something went wrong.

430
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,590
Guo Xiaotian

431
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,440
and Yang Tiexin

432
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,200
kindly invited me for a drink,

433
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,800
but

434
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,270
they died because of me.

435
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,030
Where is that bloody official?

436
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,740
(Fahua Temple)

437
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,270
I pursued them relentlessly

438
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,560
and finally learned

439
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,110
that the villain Duan Tiande

440
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,350
had hidden Li,

441
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,400
Guo's pregnant wife

442
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,680
in Fahua Temple.

443
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,110
Stop!

444
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,390
Taoist Qiu,

445
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,030
even if you want to make a name in Jiangnan,

446
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,310
you can't disturb the peace
of a Buddhist temple.

447
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,880
Shame on the place of peace!

448
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,680
Can the monks hide

449
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,110
the widow of my good friend

450
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,440
in your temple?

451
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,750
You're slandering us

452
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,640
(Reverend Jiaomu)
and defaming our temple's reputation!

453
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,590
Do you dare let me

454
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,830
search your temple?

455
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,480
If you don't release her today,

456
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,880
I'll burn

457
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,790
this Fahua Temple down.

458
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,480
Taoist, you rely on your martial arts prowess,

459
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,960
pursue fame and wealth,

460
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,750
and align with the Jin.

461
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,440
Now you chase our Song generals to here.

462
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,920
How can our Fahua Temple

463
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,200
tolerate you

464
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,400
using loyal lives

465
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,400
to curry favor

466
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,520
with the Jin?

467
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,950
Qiu Chuji.

468
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,960
We Seven Freaks of Jiangnan

469
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,960
won't let you have your way here!

470
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,270
(Only later did I learn)

471
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,640
(that Duan Tiande had falsely accused me)

472
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,030
(to Reverend Jiaomu)

473
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,590
(and the Seven Freaks of Jiangnan.)

474
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,880
(So we had a misunderstanding.)

475
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,880
(Both I and the seven heroes)

476
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,070
(were badly injured in the end.)

477
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,310
Let me go!

478
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,350
Go!

479
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,790
Why is there a woman's voice?

480
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:11,910
Go!

481
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,240
Go!

482
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,150
Taoist Qiu!

483
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,750
I'm Guo Xiaotian's wife.

484
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,160
Please save me!

485
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,870
Be quiet!

486
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,310
Think about your unborn child!

487
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,270
It really is a woman.

488
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,950
A woman

489
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,680
is hidden in the Fahua Temple.

490
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,080
Oh, no.

491
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,240
Now, we Seven Freaks of Jiangnan

492
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,790
will be known as the Seven Demons of Jiangnan.

493
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,590
Being called seven fools

494
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,830
in the martial world

495
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,480
wouldn't be an exaggeration.

496
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,560
Jiaomu!

497
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,830
You misjudged people.

498
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,510
You almost got us killed!

499
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,760
Darn it.

500
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,040
You wretched Taoist!

501
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,590
Good for you.

502
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,110
I can't mess with you.

503
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,920
I'll just avoid you.

504
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,920
So, I'll take my leave.

505
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,040
Go!

506
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,560
Reverend,

507
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,110
you really don't have to do this.

508
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,190
Listen to me.

509
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,590
Let me go!

510
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,320
Mr. Duan,

511
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,960
don't do this!

512
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,590
Reverend,

513
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,790
if you don't stop,

514
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,270
I'll have no choice but to kill you.

515
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,640
You'll feel pain

516
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,830
when I stab you.

517
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,590
Go away.

518
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,630
Go!

519
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,070
Go! Go!

520
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,080
Go!

521
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,590
Go!

522
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,720
Aren't you afraid of retribution

523
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,270
for all your sins?

524
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,350
Go!

525
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,520
Taoist!

526
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,310
(Zuixian Restaurant)
Taoist Qiu, we are

527
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,750
truly sorry for today.

528
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,680
It was my carelessness that allowed

529
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,240
that scoundrel

530
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,480
to take advantage.

531
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,400
So, what should we do now?

532
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,440
Let's settle it.

533
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,800
Today's event

534
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,270
is a disgrace

535
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,270
to both sides.

536
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,040
If we don't rescue

537
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,780
the widows of the Guo and the Yang,

538
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,680
how can we face

539
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,200
the martial world?

540
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,590
Well said.

541
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,720
So what do you suggest?

542
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,480
Now that Mrs. Guo and Mrs. Yang

543
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,960
were taken by them.

544
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,350
Let's split up

545
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,480
to rescue them.

546
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,880
We met Li,

547
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,550
Mrs. Guo today.

548
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,000
I won't forget

549
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,480
Mrs. Guo's voice.

550
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:22,950
So,

551
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,160
we'll go find Mrs. Guo.

552
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,320
Good.

553
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,830
Then I'll go find Mrs. Yang.

554
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,830
Shall we compete to see

555
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,840
who rescues first?

556
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,200
Let's save them first.

557
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,310
After Mrs. Guo and Mrs. Yang

558
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,720
give birth,

559
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,800
we will

560
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,830
teach the babies all we know.

561
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,200
18 years later,

562
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,110
we'll bring the children of Guo and Yang

563
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,350
back to Zuixian Restaurant

564
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,190
for a duel. Okay?

565
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,240
Okay.

566
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,520
We accept it.

567
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,950
Heroes, we will

568
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,270
take off soon.

569
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,440
(18 years later)

570
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,720
Today, let's

571
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,590
settle the duel

572
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,640
from 18 years ago today.

573
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,840
Luckily,

574
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,270
I can have my two seniors

575
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,360
as witnesses.

576
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,280
What do you say?

577
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,920
I agree.

578
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,800
If not

579
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,310
for your righteous help,

580
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,790
my senior brothers and I

581
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,110
would not have survived.

582
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,400
Your apprentice, Guo Jing,

583
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,670
he

584
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,030
excels in martial arts,

585
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,640
and also possesses a noble spirit.

586
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
What a man of integrity!

587
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,040
Exactly.

588
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,480
Thanks to Jing for finding
the antidote for me.

589
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,960
As for my evil apprentice Yang Kang,

590
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,240
he is morally corrupt,

591
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,150
and greedy for fame and fortune.

592
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,480
He's nowhere near

593
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,070
as good as Guo Jing.

594
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,160
Now, I concede defeat

595
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,480
in the duel we promised 18 years ago

596
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,000
at the Zuixian Restaurant.

597
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,950
Taoist, that's very nice of you.

598
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,590
We haven't done much better

599
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,960
at teaching our apprentice.

600
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,640
Guo Jing, that rascal,

601
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,950
he dared...

602
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
He dared to defy his masters

603
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,750
for that demoness from Peach Blossom Island

604
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,720
and eloped with her.

605
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,880
Big brother,

606
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,240
why do you still

607
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,080
hold a grudge over this?

608
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,590
Hero Ke,

609
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,880
don't worry.

610
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,030
Jing is an honest and loyal man.

611
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,720
If he's too obedient

612
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,110
to masters and seniors,

613
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,880
he won't have any independent opinions.

614
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,390
Now,

615
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,030
he has his own choice.

616
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,000
Perhaps it's a good thing.

617
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,080
Big brother,

618
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,720
I think Taoist Ma is correct.

619
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,240
We've been

620
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,550
a bit hard on Jing.

621
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,280
Everyone.

622
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,160
As far as I can tell,

623
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,270
Huang Rong truly cares

624
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,000
for Jing.

625
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,160
That girl

626
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,160
really likes Jing.

627
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,030
And Jing will never

628
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,640
like any other girls

629
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,920
besides her.

630
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,200
Congratulations to you all.

631
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,310
Your apprentice

632
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,200
finally will finish his apprenticeship.

633
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,920
Since that's the case,

634
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,520
I will

635
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,430
let him be this time.

636
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,830
There you go.

637
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,920
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

638
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,150

639
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,280
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

640
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,160
We've finally found you.

641
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,250
Please go back with us.

642
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,190
- His Royal Highness is worried about you.
- Yes, Your Highness.

643
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,680
I'm not a prince. Stay back.

644
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,820
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

645
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,110
Get lost!

646
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,680
- Yes.
- Your Highness.

647
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,530
Fragrant bags! Pendants!

648
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,020
Umbrellas!

649
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,000
Do you like it?

650
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,070
I've never had it before.

651
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,830
But it tastes good.

652
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,080
Father said

653
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,400
Mother used to cook the noodles

654
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,680
for him.

655
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,880
For these 18 years,

656
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,030
Mother longed for such a life.

657
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,440
I don't understand.

658
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,670
If it were you,

659
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,920
would you choose to be a princess

660
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,030
or go back to the Niujia Village?

661
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,750
I'll go back to the Niujia Village.

662
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,200
And I won't come to

663
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,480
Zhongdu anymore.

664
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,960
This is my father's iron spear.

665
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,680
I'll give it to you as a keepsake.

666
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,460
(Yang Tiexin)

667
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,640
How did you find me?

668
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,800
Anyway,

669
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,510
I can find you if I want to.

670
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,360
Will you marry Guo Jing?

671
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:12,950
I won't.

672
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,400
But Father betrothed you

673
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,110
to Guo Jing before he died.

674
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,320
He won't marry me.

675
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,710
And I won't marry him.

676
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,200
Why?

677
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,280
He loves someone else.

678
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,070
Besides,

679
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,550
Father had betrothed me

680
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,670
to someone else before.

681
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,800
To that

682
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,280
dandyish prince of Jin?

683
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,840
Not this wretch bullying his master,

684
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,670
betraying his ancestors,

685
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,000
and not even knowing

686
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,230
his family name!

687
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,190
I don't know any prince of Jin.

688
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,590
I only know Yang Kang, a man

689
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,320
with a tragic past and a deep-seated vendetta.

690
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,440
Father had betrothed me

691
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,920
to him.

692
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,280
