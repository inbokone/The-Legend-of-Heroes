00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,940
=Hot Blooded=

2
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,280
Mother.

4
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,510
Mother.

5
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,360
Kang.

6
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,170
Mother, are you not feeling well again?

7
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,660
I'm just worried about you.

8
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,410
I'm an unfilial son,

9
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,890
making you worry.

10
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,690
Mother, look.

11
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,580
I haven't even lost a toe.

12
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,380
Please rest easy.

13
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,710
Why is this princess dressed like

14
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,690
a country woman

15
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,290
and living in such a shabby house?

16
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,240
Was she banished by Prince Zhao?

17
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,620
She's like you,

18
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,810
pretending to be poor for fun.

19
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,430
You are annoying.

20
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,940
Look, your hand is injured,

21
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,970
and your arm is swollen.

22
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,960
It's okay if your father finds out

23
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,660
that you have been stirring up trouble.

24
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,390
But if your master knows about it,

25
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,500
it will be a problem.

26
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,080
Do you know who the Taoist is

27
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,180
that disrupted today?

28
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,600
Who's he?

29
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,730
He is my master Qiu Chuji's

30
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,060
junior fellow apprentice.

31
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,320
Then we must

32
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,500
treat him with respect

33
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,810
to avoid angering your master.

34
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,160
Okay.

35
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,570
I'll follow your lead.

36
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,670
Kang,

37
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,290
what are your plans

38
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,970
for today's martial duel?

39
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,190
I've already had the father and daughter

40
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,100
brought back

41
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,730
and treated them well with food and drink.

42
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,690
It's not enough to just offer that

43
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,100
after playing a trick on them.

44
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,360
You need to give them some money

45
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,500
to make amends

46
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,940
and ensure they bear no grudge.

47
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,200
And

48
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,030
you must not act recklessly

49
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,110
outside anymore,

50
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,970
or

51
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,850
I will truly be upset.

52
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,760
Yes, Mother.

53
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,250
I thought he was kind,

54
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,080
But he's so deceitful.

55
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,960
Good food? Good drink?

56
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,900
- Shame on him...
- Shh!

57
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,000
Do you really want to

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,140
expose yourself and confront him?

59
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,760
Fortunately, Hero Mu

60
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,620
didn't fall for his trick.

61
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,920
But

62
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,620
the princess is quite reasonable.

63
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,410
But I'm glad

64
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,780
you inviting the father and daughter

65
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,100
home today.

66
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,500
You are growing up.

67
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,660
Take me to meet them now.

68
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,460
I didn't keep my son in line.

69
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,800
So I should

70
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,250
apologize to them properly.

71
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,290
No need, Mother.

72
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,290
They've already forgiven me.

73
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,040
Now they have had their meal

74
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,880
and are about to leave.

75
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,570
I almost forgot.

76
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,520
I found an injured rabbit

77
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,360
just now.

78
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,400
It's pitiful.

79
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,730
So I brought it here.

80
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,430
Mother,

81
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,730
please do something.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,840
Let me see.

83
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,140
Where is it hurt?

84
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,100
Poor thing.

85
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,480
Mother,

86
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,530
please take care of it.

87
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,070
I will

88
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,710
fetch some money for the father

89
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,580
and the daughter later.

90
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,930
The young prince is truly despicable.

91
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,160
I can't believe he even

92
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,460
deceived his mother.

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,530
- He is so...
- Forget it.

94
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,990
Let's go find the herbs.

95
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,850
The mansion is huge.

96
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,660
Where should we find the herbs?

97
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,290
I have an idea.

98
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,520
Be quiet,

99
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,600
or you'll be killed.

100
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,790
Alright. Alright. Alright.

101
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,080
- Who are you?
- I- I...

102
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,910
I'm the butler of Prince Zhao's Mansion.

103
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,750
You're the butler?

104
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,520
Great!

105
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,560
Where does the young prince
keep the herbs he asked you to buy?

106
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,950
His... His Highness

107
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,000
keeps them himself.

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,970
I don't know that.

109
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,340
You don't know that?

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,320
Please! Please spare me!

111
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,580
I- I really don't know that.

112
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,050
I'm not that patient.

113
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,070
Feel good?

114
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,000
How about your left arm?

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,590
I swear I don't know.

116
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,590
Even if you kill me, I still don't know.

117
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,430
Fine,

118
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,480
I believe you.

119
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,150
But you must

120
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,370
go to your young prince

121
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,520
and tell him

122
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,820
you fell from a height,

123
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,100
injured your arm

124
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,100
and suffered internal injuries.

125
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
The doctor said you need

126
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,560
panax notoginseng, blood resin,

127
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,850
bear bile and myrrh.

128
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,730
You can't find them in any pharmacies.

129
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
So you ask your young prince

130
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
for some of them.

131
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,660
I- I understand.

132
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,670
Heroine,

133
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,050
what's that?

134
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,850
This is my Emei Piercer.

135
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,490
There's a potent poison on it.

136
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,970
Without my antidote,

137
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,100
you'll be dead

138
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,520
by tomorrow morning.

139
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,120
I'll do anything for you, Heroine.

140
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,220
Young prince is with the princess.

141
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,930
If you don't take the antidote,

142
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,200
your body

143
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,370
will deteriorate bit by bit.

144
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,780
- Go!
- Yes. Yes.

145
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,340
I didn't expect Brother Huang...

146
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,850
No, Rong,

147
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,290
can do this.

148
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,440
Your Royal Highness, I've injured my arm.

149
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,780
Please give me some herbs.

150
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,720
Kang,

151
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,290
go get him the herbs.

152
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,700
Mr. Liang took them all.

153
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,160
You go find him.

154
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,930
Please give me a note, Your Highness.

155
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,360
The doctor said

156
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,630
I need bear bile, panax notoginseng,

157
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,580
blood resin, and myrrh.

158
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,700
Thank you, Your Highness.

159
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,980
(Xiangxue Hall)

160
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,930
Rong, look.

161
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,550
Rinpoche Lingzhi

162
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,900
used a poisonous palm to Taoist Wang.

163
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,610
He's not feeling well either.

164
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,820
This room is full of Jin's laykeys.

165
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,930
There are no real heroes.

166
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,390
Aren't we

167
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,050
the two heroes on the beam?

168
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,100
Mr. Liang, I beg you

169
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,780
to help me with this urgent matter.

170
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,140
(Blood resin, panax notoginseng,
myrrh and bear bile.)

171
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,930
It's the young prince's handwriting.

172
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,140
Mr. Liang, please save me.

173
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,830
Give the butler

174
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,000
five qian
[*Qian: a weight unit]

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,020
of each herb

176
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,290
that His Highness sent today.

177
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,290
- Thank you, Mr. Liang.
- Yes.

178
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,050
Rong, let's go.

179
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,520
Wait.

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,780
Looks like they are discussing
something important.

181
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,310
I'll stay.

182
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,700
- You go get the herbs.
- Okay.

183
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,100
They are masters in martial arts.

184
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,680
If you jump down,

185
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,770
you'll be discovered.

186
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,520
Then...

187
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,400
I'll help you.

188
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,550
Bye.

189
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,140
(Wanyan Honglie, Sixth Prince
of the Jin Empire)

190
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,610
Sorry to keep you waiting.

191
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,220
Your Royal Highness.

192
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,340
I invited you all today

193
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,650
to speak openly.

194
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,280
No matter what,

195
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,490
I won't hold it.

196
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,850
Please do not mention it

197
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,770
to others about

198
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,370
what we'll discuss today

199
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,940
to avoid alerting them

200
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,700
and ruining our grand plan for Jin.

201
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,330
Rest assured, Your Royal Highness.

202
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,580
We will

203
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,920
keep it a secret.

204
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,850
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

205
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,820
Decades ago,

206
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,320
our Jin army, led by two marshals,

207
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,750
conquered Song

208
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,460
and captured their two emperors.

209
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,130
That's the peak

210
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,820
of our military strength since ancient times.

211
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,060
Back then, people said Jin soldiers
descended from the heaven.

212
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,540
It's a legend.

213
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,340
Shame on you.

214
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,370
At that time, our army was strong.

215
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,300
We could have unified the country.

216
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,420
But

217
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,840
it's been nearly 100 years.

218
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,680
That Song Emperor is still

219
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,970
in Lin'an.

220
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,580
Do you know why?

221
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,890
Please enlighten us, Your Royal Highness.

222
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,510
Back then,

223
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,650
our army was defeated by Yue Fei.

224
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,250
Everyone knows this

225
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,490
so there's no need to avoid it.

226
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,630
Now, I have an ambition.

227
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,130
I want to achieve great deeds

228
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,180
for our emperor.

229
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,310
I really

230
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,490
need your help.

231
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,580
We will do our best.

232
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,850
Who is this?

233
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,180
This is a servant.

234
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,750
He has served the prince with me

235
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,610
for many years.

236
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,070
Your Royal Highness,

237
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,470
charging into battle and conquering cities

238
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,650
is not our expertise.

239
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,130
Do you want us

240
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,700
to assassinate marshals
and generals of the Song?

241
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,770
A few months ago,

242
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,130
I was looking through
old documents in the palace

243
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,800
and accidentally discovered a document

244
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,370
from the previous dynasty.

245
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,550
It turns out that Yue Fei

246
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,460
knew he wouldn't survive

247
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,370
in the prison,

248
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,830
so he wrote down

249
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,320
everything about his knowledge,

250
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,340
all of his military strategies

251
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,580
and secrets of training and battle

252
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,060
in a detailed book.

253
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,870
He intended to give this book

254
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,970
to the Song

255
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,250
to resist our Jin army.

256
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,130
Fortunately,

257
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,540
good for Qin Hui.

258
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,470
He feared Yue Fei

259
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,180
would communicate with outsiders,

260
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,490
so he guarded Yue closely.

261
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,070
So,

262
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,340
even after Yue's death,

263
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,610
this book was never revealed

264
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,130
to others.

265
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,700
Yue Fei was a military genius.

266
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,100
He was very skilled in commanding battles.

267
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,400
If we can get

268
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,540
the Book of Wumu,

269
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,940
unifying the country

270
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,180
would be easy.

271
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,120
Please come in.

272
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,470
Please wait a moment.

273
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,920
Give it to me.

274
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,890
I originally thought

275
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,400
the Book of Wumu

276
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,650
was buried with Yue Fei.

277
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,830
Although Yue Fei was our enemy,

278
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,420
he was loyal and courageous.

279
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,820
We cannot dig his grave.

280
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,480
I found an important clue

281
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,650
from reports

282
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,010
sent by our spies in the Southern Song.

283
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,640
Your Royal Highness.

284
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,730
What is it?

285
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,160
Master,

286
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,610
someone broke into our pharmacy for herbs.

287
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,950
Your Royal Highness,

288
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,490
I'll take my leave.

289
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,850
Mr. Liang, please calm down.

290
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,640
Let's go.

291
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,850
What's going on?

292
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,950
Why did this happen?

293
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,730
I feel so hot.

294
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,520
It's hot.

295
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,550
It's hot.

296
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,130
(What is Jing going to do about that?)

297
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,010
(I should find him.)

298
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,670
Who's there?

299
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,220
You're not bad at martial arts.

300
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,770
Who are you?

301
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,680
The plum blossoms in this garden

302
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,770
are quite nice.

303
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,770
Who can pick one for me?

304
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,680
No one? I'll get it myself then.

305
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,520
Stop.

306
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,300
Since you're not from the mansion,

307
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,610
you can't go easily.

308
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,650
Why are you old men

309
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,470
pestering a child like me?

310
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,920
We want to know

311
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,490
who are you

312
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,370
and who's your master.

313
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,680
And,

314
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,250
why did you sneak

315
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,080
into the mansion,

316
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,400
what did you steal

317
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,300
and what did your overhear?

318
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,410
Holy Turtle Steps?

319
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,820
You learned from Twin Killers in the Dark Wind?

320
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,000
How can you associate me

321
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,310
with those two evil traitors?

322
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,150
Shut up!

323
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,120
You are a junior in martial world.

324
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,720
How dare you insult

325
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,710
Twin Killers in the Dark Wind?

326
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,240
Today, I'll see

327
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,780
how skilled you are!

328
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,890
Take this!

329
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,300
Soft Hedgehog Armor?

330
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,100
You have Soft Hedgehog Armor?

331
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,160
How do you know about

332
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,370
the amazing Soft Hedgehog Armor?

333
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,600
Soft Hedgehog Armor is the treasure

334
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,920
of Peach Blossom Island in Eastern Sea.

335
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,170
You are so young.

336
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,600
But you dare to steal herbs from the mansion

337
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,690
eavesdrop,

338
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,960
and steal Soft Hedgehog Armor

339
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,370
from Peach Blossom Island.

340
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,580
Thieves think about

341
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,210
thieves' tricks.

342
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,720
Why don't you think

343
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,580
this armor belongs to my family?

344
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,510
You're from the Peach Blossom Island?

345
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,850
Luckily, you didn't hurt me.

346
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,690
So, see you then.

347
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,850
Should we just let her go like that?

348
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,450
Huang Yaoshi

349
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,650
is powerful and solitary.

350
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,400
If he knows we troubled someone

351
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,790
from the Peach Blossom Island,

352
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,930
we'll be in big trouble.

353
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,020
Let's kill her

354
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,500
to avoid future problems.

355
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,370
I agree.

356
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,150
Attack!

357
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,060
What's happening?

358
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,240
My snake...

359
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,690
My snake!

360
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,870
My snake.

361
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,680
What's wrong?

362
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,850
Over ten years!

363
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:16,210
It has eaten my precious herbs and elixirs!

364
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,270
I almost can absord its blood

365
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,130
and go to cultivate.

366
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,500
Now everything

367
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,410
is ruined!

368
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,590
Did the thief

369
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,060
target your snake?

370
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,980
It must have been for a while.

371
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,310
Absorb my snake's blood

372
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,030
can gain 20 years

373
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,650
of inner power and cultivation.

374
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,350
Hero Mu.

375
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,590
Miss Mu.

376
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,240
Young man,

377
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,440
why are you here?

378
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,610
I'm here to get you out.

379
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,130
Young man, you've helped us many times.

380
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,990
I haven't asked your name yet.

381
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,020
I'm Guo Jing.

382
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,440
Guo...

383
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,680
Let's go.

384
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,760
Miss Mu.

385
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,100
Wait, young man.

386
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,720
Is your "Jing"

387
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,890
from the Jingkang Incident?

388
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:19,960
Yes.

389
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,300
What's your father's name?

390
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,450
His name was Xiaotian.

391
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,850
Oh!

392
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,060
Oh!

393
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,310
Mr. Mu,

394
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,540
what's wrong?

395
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,650
Your mother's family name is Li,

396
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,800
right?

397
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,780
How do you know?

398
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,110
Where is she?

399
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,450
Is she doing well?

400
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,500
My mother's great.

401
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,690
She's in the desert.

402
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,450
Mr. Mu, how do you know my parents?

403
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,820
Your father was my sworn brother.

404
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,070
We swore to be brothers

405
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,500
and we were like real family.

406
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:15,830
Big brother,

407
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,930
it's been 18 years
since we parted in Niujia Village.

408
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,580
It feels like a lifetime.

409
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,550
Mr. Mu,

410
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,890
I heard from my mother

411
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,820
that my father had a sworn brother.

412
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,780
But his family name isn't Mu.

413
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,260
My name was Yang Tiexin.

414
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,100
After that disaster in Niujia Village,

415
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,410
I dared not use my real name.

416
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,060
So I changed my name

417
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,370
from Yang Tiexin

418
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,580
to Mu Yi.

419
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,100
I am truly fortunate.

420
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,170
In this vast world,

421
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,960
I finally meet

422
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,300
my sworn brother's son.

423
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,370
Guo Jing kowtows

424
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,600
to Uncle Yang.

425
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,210
Please rise up.

426
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,270
Uncle Yang, let's get out of here.

427
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,510
We can talk later. Go.

428
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,580
I can't leave now.

429
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,300
I was invited here

430
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,820
for my daughter's marriage.

431
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,650
If I leave now,

432
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,020
that would be escaping.

433
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,130
Being right would turn to wrong.

434
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,540
Wanyan Kang

435
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,780
is very cunning.

436
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,400
His earlier words

437
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,450
were lies to you

438
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,680
and Sister Mu.

439
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,100
We can't believe him.

440
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,930
I know that.

441
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,060
He doesn't listen to reason,

442
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,170
so I'll reason with his parents.

443
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,410
No matter what,

444
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,780
I will seek justice

445
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,540
for Nianci.

446
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,540
Let's get out of here. Go.

447
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,020
Brother Guo. Someone's coming.

448
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,200
Were they locked up

449
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,540
by His Highness yesterday?

450
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,800
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

451
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,610
Release them.

452
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,440
Your Royal Highness,

453
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,600
His Highness

454
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,930
ordered them to be imprisoned.

455
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
You can tell him

456
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,060
I ordered their release.

457
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,550
But...

458
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,690
But... How...

459
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,440
Do you want me to speak to the prince

460
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,740
and the young prince?

461
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,500
No. No.

462
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,760
Go.

463
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,040
Give them the money.

464
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm sorry

465
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,540
for the offense today.

466
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,340
It's all my son's fault.

467
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,200
They are so rude.

468
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,020
Don't even thank the princess for saving them.

469
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,750
(Ouyang Ke, Young Master
of White Camel Mountain Manor)

470
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,370
Are you okay, miss?

471
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,590
You are not as unreasonable

472
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,540
as those old men.

473
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,130
May I know your name?

474
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,820
- Rong.
- Family name?

475
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,650
I can't tell you that.

476
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,470
Interesting.

477
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,550
Who are you,

478
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,390
brat?

479
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,030
Dare to flirt

480
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,100
in front of us!

481
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,570
I should thank you for making me look sharp.

482
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,440
What?

483
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,300
- Brat!
- Heroes.

484
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,740
We are all on the same side.

485
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,520
Your Royal Highness.

486
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,020
Let me introduce you.

487
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,440
This is Ouyang Ke, young master
of White Camel Mountain Manor

488
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,580
in the Kunlun Mountains

489
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,170
of the Western Regions.

490
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,510
Ouyang Ke has never been to the Central Plains.

491
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,440
You must all be meeting

492
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,060
for the first time.

493
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,210
I should have arrived in Zhongdu earlier.

494
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,020
But I was delayed on the way.

495
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,260
Please forgive me.

496
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,610
It's okay.

497
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:48,370
Your uncle Ouyang Feng
must be worried about you.

498
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,410
No wonder you're so exceptional.

499
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,680
Your uncle

500
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,100
is the Western Venom Ouyang Feng.

501
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,270
Ouyang Ke's visit

502
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,820
is an honor for me.

503
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,200
Your Royal Highness.

504
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,130
I have a small request.

505
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,350
Please go ahead.

506
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,960
I find this girl

507
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,800
very interesting.

508
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,500
I'd like to spar with her.

509
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,850
I hope your heroes won't compete

510
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,780
with me for this chance.

511
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,850
Since Ouyang Ke requested it,

512
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,610
then I'll leave

513
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,170
this girl to you.

514
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,170
A thief broke into the mansion today.

515
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,270
I'll go check on the princess.

516
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,130
Goodbye.

517
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,610
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

518
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,780
(The mansion is huge.)

519
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,980
(Where should I find Rong?)

520
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,390
It's so humiliating.

521
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,750
We were beaten by a brat.

522
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,750
Shut up.

523
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,720
- Where are you going?
- Enough!

524
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,000
- I want to beat him.
- You know what?

525
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,110
We Four Devils of the Yellow River

526
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,980
are disgraced!

527
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,470
- It's you!
- It's that brat!

528
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,820
- It's you!
- Brat, enemies meet again.

529
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,580
- Hit him!
- Hit him! Attack!

530
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,510
How did he suddenly become so strong?

531
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,350
Impossible.

532
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,850
This must be an illusion.

533
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,130
We haven't eaten yet.

534
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,580
What's going on?

535
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,680
Little thief,

536
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,960
did you enjoy the snake blood?

537
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,720
Old thief, I don't want your snake blood.

538
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,920
It bit me.

539
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,880
Now I'm burning up.

540
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,720
Is that my fault?

541
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,710
You little rascal!

542
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,790
Don't go too far!

543
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,980
I'll absorb your blood!

544
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,440
(This little thief's power increased)

545
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,960
(after drinking my snake blood.)

546
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,480
Give me back my snake blood!

547
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,320
Sir!

548
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,200
I didn't steal your snake blood.

549
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,100
Let's stop.

550
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,370
Come back!

551
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,580
It's nice to meet you.

552
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,110
I'm from Mount White Camel in Kunlun...

553
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,930
It's too long. And I don't have
a hearing problem.

554
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,280
Alright.

555
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,580
Do you want to spar with me?

556
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,740
Are these beauties from your family?

557
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,070
Yes.

558
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,680
But

559
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,640
all their beauty combined

560
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,580
doesn't match

561
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,060
half of yours.

562
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,580
You have good taste.

563
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,060
But I don't have time for this.

564
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,040
I have to go.

565
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,300
If you can stop those old men,

566
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,680
that would be best.

567
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,000
Okay.

568
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,540
But you have to promise me something.

569
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,170
You should be my apprentice

570
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,740
and follow me forever.

571
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,920
Be your apprentice?

572
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,510
Why should I follow you forever?

573
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,740
I'm different from others.

574
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,930
I only take beautiful girls as apprentices.

575
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,260
And they must stay with me for life.

576
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,830
Wherever I go,

577
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,650
they should go with me.

578
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,170
Whatever I ask them to do,

579
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,060
they should do.

580
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,740
If you're really that skilled,

581
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,650
I don't mind being your apprentice

582
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,690
to avoid being bullied

583
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,260
by these old men.

584
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,990
Do you want to try?

585
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,830
Yes.

586
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,370
How do we decide win or lose?

587
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,930
Now we're both in this circle.

588
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,820
Who gets pushed out first

589
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,210
loses.

590
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,410
What if we both are pushed out?

591
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,000
Then I lose.

592
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,150
If you lose,

593
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,580
you and these old men

594
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,920
can't bother me.

595
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,760
Of course.

596
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,910
Alright.

597
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:41,870
I'm leaving now.

598
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,270
You didn't push me out.

599
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,500
I came out on my own.

600
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,070
And you can't leave the circle to stop me.

601
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,370
Because if we both leave the circle,

602
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,550
you'll lose.

603
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,680
You two are laughing now?

604
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,880
That girl ran.

605
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,790
Do you think Huang Yaoshi

606
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,060
will spare us?

607
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,360
We are too careless.

608
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,930
- Quickly! Quickly!
- Go get her!

609
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,650
Interesting.

610
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,130
Where did he go?

611
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,890
Who's causing trouble?

612
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,640
The brat you fought

613
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,850
during the day!

614
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,790
That troublemaking fool?

615
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,630
It's him!

616
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,650
I know him even if he turns to ashes.

617
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,690
During the day, he pretended to be a gentleman.

618
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,270
But at night, he sneaks into my mansion,

619
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,340
stealing and causing trouble.

620
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,890
So stupid!

621
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,450
Go find him.

622
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,690
We'll have some fun.

623
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,170
Yes, Your Highness.

624
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,610
Where is he?

625
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,960
Your Royal Highness,

626
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,820
what brings you here

627
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,110
so late?

628
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,610
A thief broke into the mansion today.

629
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,450
I fear he might disturb the princess,

630
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,260
so I came here.

631
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,130
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

632
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,850
What are you thinking about alone?

633
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,680
Your Royal Highness.

634
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,170
Actually, I wanted

635
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,980
to ask you.

636
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,790
Could you please

637
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,780
think about it again?

638
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,060
Back then, did you really

639
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,580
see him die?

640
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,880
I'll never forget that snowy night

641
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,850
in Niujia Village, 18 years ago.

642
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,880
As a secret envoy of Jin,

643
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,740
I went to obtain military intelligence
from the Song.

644
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,550
But I was ambushed

645
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,980
by Qiu Chuji.

646
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,450
I was fortunate

647
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,210
to escape.

648
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,250
Taoist, may I ask your name?

649
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,470
My name

650
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,100
is Qiu Chuji.

651
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,780
(Niujia Village)

652
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,020
Good rabbit,

653
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,210
you're lucky today.

654
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,020
If bad people catch you,

655
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,250
they'll kill you and eat you.

656
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:43,650
Here, let me apply some medicine.

657
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,980
You stay here and recover.

658
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,690
Who's there?

659
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,560
Xiruo.

660
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,170
Coming.

661
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,940
You're really bold

662
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,940
hiding in my house.

663
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,210
You should go tomorrow.

664
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,250
If my husband finds out,

665
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,540
he won't let you go.

666
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,740
(Token)

667
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,130
Your Royal Highness.

668
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,980
I have a favor

669
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,580
to ask you.

670
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,540
Thank heavens.

671
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,810
You're awake.

672
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,020
It's you.

673
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,980
You have a fever.

674
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,170
A doctor came.

675
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,610
The child is fine.

676
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,130
You rest well.

677
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,290
Where am I?

678
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,610
Where's my husband?

679
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,810
The soldiers are searching outside.

680
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,550
We're temporarily

681
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,690
staying in an inn.

682
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,250
Sorry for pretending

683
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,130
to be your husband.

684
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,210
Please don't reveal your identity.

685
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,460
Where's my husband?

686
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,610
Please calm down.

687
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:25,950
Take care of your body.

688
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,060
You're pregnant now.

689
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,730
Tell me.

690
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,060
Where is he?

691
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,940
I heard about the trouble in Niujia Village.

692
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,170
To repay your kindness,

693
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,650
I went to help.

694
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,610
I rescued you on the way,

695
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:47,830
but...

696
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,320
I saw your husband,

697
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,210
Yang Tiexin,

698
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,290
was shot by soldiers' arrows.

699
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,910
Yes.

700
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,670
I saw him get hit by arrows

701
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,980
and fall off a cliff.

702
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,130
After all these years,

703
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,070
you still don't believe

704
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,210
what I said.

705
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,900
You ask me

706
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,900
every now and then.

707
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,250
18 years have passed.

708
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,440
How many more times do you need to ask

709
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,610
before you believe me?

710
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,030
It's not that I don't believe...

711
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,540
You don't want to believe.

712
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,380
Xiruo,

713
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,250
time have passed.

714
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,290
I've already changed,

715
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,060
but you're still the same.

716
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,500
Sorry, Your Royal Highness.

717
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,170
You never cared about me.

718
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,060
I just thought nonsense.

719
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,130
I miss my home.

720
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,020
I miss Niujia Village.

721
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,540
I want to go back and have a look.

722
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,940
Your miss your home?

723
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,200
I've moved

724
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,360
the house and all its belongings

725
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,670
from Niujia Village

726
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,100
into the mansion.

727
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,540
Isn't here your home?

728
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,560
Alright.

729
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,920
Tomorrow, I'll send people

730
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,020
to escort you to Niujia Village.

731
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,810
But you must promise to return quickly.

732
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,610
Kang and I will wait for you here.

733
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,100
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

734
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,870
Who's there?

735
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,650
